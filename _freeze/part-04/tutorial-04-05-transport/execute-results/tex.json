As always, don't worry if you're new to optimization - we'll walk through everything step by step using a real-world example.\n\nImagine you're running a solar panel distribution company. You have several warehouses (suppliers) and need to ship solar panels to various solar farms (customers). Your goal is to minimize the total cost of transportation while meeting all customer demands.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:\n\n1. Understand what a transportation problem is\n2. Set up a transportation problem using JuMP\n3.

We have several options now on how to deal with these data sets. As our suppliers and customers are given names, it might be useful to convert the data into dictionaries. Dictionaries are a great data structure that allow us to store key-value pairs, where the keys are unique identifiers and the values are the data associated with those keys. By using dictionaries, we can easily access and modify the data associated with a specific key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\navailable_dict = Dict(\n    available.supplier .=> available.truckloads_available\n)\nrequested_dict = Dict(\n    requested.solar_farm .=> requested.truckload_demand\n)\ntravelCosts_dict = Dict(\n    (row.supplier,row.solar_farm) => row.costs \n    for row in eachrow(travelCosts)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nYou can use the `Dict` function to create a dictionary from two arrays or DataFrames. For example: `Dict(keys .=> values)` will create a dictionary where the keys are the elements of the `keys` array and the values are the elements of the `values` array.\n:::\n\nNow, let us check out the dictionaries. We can use the `first` function to get the first few key-value pairs of a dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nprintln(\"Available panels:\")\nfirst(available_dict,5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAvailable panels:\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n5-element Vector{Pair{String7, Int64}}:\n \"a_13\" => 145\n \"a_17\" => 181\n \"a_26\" => 405\n \"a_90\" => 479\n \"a_67\" => 430\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nprintln(\"Travel costs:\")\nfirst(travelCosts_dict,5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTravel costs:\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n5-element Vector{Pair{Tuple{String7, String7}, Int64}}:\n (\"a_33\", \"b_450\") => 1903\n (\"a_99\", \"b_340\") => 1749\n (\"a_74\", \"b_249\") => 7016\n (\"a_11\", \"b_278\") => 5788\n  (\"a_40\", \"b_35\") => 11369\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, we can also access the value associated with a specific key in a dictionary by using the key inside square brackets. For example: `available_dict[\"a_1\"]` will return the value associated with the key `\"a_1\"`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nprint(\"Value associated with supplier 'a_1': \")\navailable_dict[\"a_1\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nValue associated with supplier 'a_1': \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n478\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur travel costs dictionary is a bit more complex, as it is dictionary with tuples as keys. We can access the value associated with a specific supplier and customer by using two keys inside square brackets. For example: `travelCosts_dict[(\"a_1\",\"b_1\")]` will return the value associated with the keys `(\"a_1\",\"b_1\")`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nprint(\"Value associated with supplier 'a_1' and customer 'b_1': \")\ntravelCosts_dict[(\"a_1\",\"b_1\")]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nValue associated with supplier 'a_1' and customer 'b_1': \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n8052\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also extract the keys and values of a dictionary using the `keys` and `values` functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nprintln(\"Keys of the travel costs dictionary:\")\nfirst(keys(travelCosts_dict),5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nKeys of the travel costs dictionary:\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n5-element Vector{Tuple{String7, String7}}:\n (\"a_33\", \"b_450\")\n (\"a_99\", \"b_340\")\n (\"a_74\", \"b_249\")\n (\"a_11\", \"b_278\")\n (\"a_40\", \"b_35\")\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nprintln(\"Values of the travel costs dictionary:\")\nfirst(values(travelCosts_dict),5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nValues of the travel costs dictionary:\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n5-element Vector{Int64}:\n  1903\n  1749\n  7016\n  5788\n 11369\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nYou can also use the `haskey` function to check if a key is in a dictionary. For example, `haskey(travelCosts_dict,(\"a_1\",\"b_1\"))` will return `true` if `(\"a_1\",\"b_1\")` is a key in `travelCosts_dict`, and `false` otherwise.\n:::\n\nDictionaries make it a lot easier to access the data later on, as we can use the keys to directly access the desired value in our model. This will be useful when we want to define the constraints later on.\n\n# Section 3 - The model instance\n\nAfter the preprocessing and data loading, we now can create the model instance with the HiGHS optimizer. \n\n## Exercise 3.1 - Creating the model instance\n\nFrom the last tutorial, you should know how to do this. Create a model instance called `transport_model` and set the optimizer to HiGHS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Test your answer\n@assert typeof(transport_model) == JuMP.Model\nprintln(\"Model instance created successfully!\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Section 4 - Defining the model\n\n## Define the variables\n\nWe can now define the variables of our model. We need to define a variable for each supplier and customer pair. As before, we can use the `@variable` macro to define the variables. The syntax is `@variable(model, varname[index1,index2] >= 0)`, where `model` is the model instance, `varname` is the name of the variable, and `index1` and `index2` are the indices of the variable. We can use vectors as input for the indices, but we could also use the keys of the dictionaries. In the following code block we mixed both options, to show you that it is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n# Define variable\n@variable(\n    transport_model, \n    X[available.supplier,keys(requested_dict)] >= 0\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Define the objective\n\nNext, we can define the objective of our model. We want to maximize the profit, which is the revenue minus the variable costs and the transportation costs. As before, we can use the `@objective` macro to define the objective. The syntax is `@objective(model, Max, expression)`, where `model` is the model instance, `Max` indicates that we want to maximize the expression, and `expression` is the expression we want to maximize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@objective(transport_model, Max, \n    sum((revenue-varCosts-travelCosts_dict[(i,j)]) * X[i,j] \n    for i in keys(available_dict), j in keys(requested_dict))\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Define the constraints\n\nWe can now define the constraints of our model. We need to ensure that the supply from each supplier is enough to cover the demand of each customer. We can use the `@constraint` macro to define the constraints. The syntax is `@constraint(model, expression)`, where `model` is the model instance and `expression` is the expression we want to constrain.\n\nTo illustrate the use of dictionaries, we will again use the keys of the dictionaries to define the constraints in the following code block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@constraint(transport_model, \n    restrictAvailable[i in keys(available_dict)], \n    sum(X[i,j] for j in keys(requested_dict)) <= available_dict[i]\n)\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, we could also use the vectors with the names from the DataFrames to define the constraints or we could also just work with ranges from the beginning, e.g. `1:length(available.supplier)` and `1:length(requested.solar_farm)`. Working with names is often more convenient, though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n@constraint(transport_model,\n    restrictDemand[j in requested.solar_farm], \n    sum(X[i,j] for i in available.supplier) <= requested_dict[j]\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that's it! We have now defined the model and can start optimizing.\n\n# Section 5 - Solving the model\n\n## Exercise 5.1 - Start optimization\n\nStart the optimization as usual by calling the `optimize!` function on the model instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Test your answer\n@assert termination_status(transport_model) == MOI.OPTIMAL\nprintln(\"Model optimized successfully!\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can access the values of the variables at the optimal solution. But remember, we defined the variables with the keys of the dictionaries, so we need to convert the result back to a DataFrame. Calling the variable itself will just show the structure of the variable, not the values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nfirst(X,5)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, we need to use the `value` function to extract the values from the variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ntransport_values = value.(X)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is a `DenseAxisArray{Float64,2,...}` with index sets. To convert it to a DataFrame, we just need to iterate over the keys dictionaries and store the values in a new DataFrame. As we are not interested in values which are zero, we can skip those.\n\nFirst, we need to initialize an empty DataFrame with the correct column names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ntransport_df = DataFrame(\n    supplier = [],\n    solar_farm = [],\n    truckloads = []\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{tabular}{r|ccc}\n\t& supplier & solar\\_farm & truckloads\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t& Any & Any & Any\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, we can iterate over the keys of the dictionaries and store the values in the DataFrame if they are greater than zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nfor i in keys(available_dict)\n    for j in keys(requested_dict)\n        if transport_values[i,j] > 0\n            push!(transport_df, (\n                supplier = i,\n                solar_farm = j,\n                truckloads = transport_values[i,j]\n                )\n            )\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can print the first few rows of the transportation plan to check if it looks correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=0}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nprintln(\"Begining of the transportation plan:\")\nfirst(transport_df,5)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nAlthough the above code looks rather complicated, it is essentially just iterating over the keys of the dictionaries and storing the values in a new DataFrame. This is a common pattern in optimization, as we often want to convert the result of an optimization problem into a more convenient format for reporting or further processing.\n:::\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, we have learned how to model and solve the transportation problem using JuMP.

However, I strongly encourage you to work on these exercises independently without searching explicitly for the exact answers to the exercises. Understanding someone else's solution is very different from developing your own. Use the lecture notes and try to solve the exercises on your own. This approach will significantly enhance your learning and problem-solving skills.\n\nRemember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with different approaches, and don't hesitate to ask for clarification during class discussions.\n\nLater, you will find the solutions to these exercises online in the associated GitHub repository, but we will also quickly go over them in next week's tutorial. To access the solutions, click on the Github button on the lower right and search for the folder with today's lecture and tutorial. Alternatively, you can ask ChatGPT or Claude to explain them to you. But please remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities.\n\n",
