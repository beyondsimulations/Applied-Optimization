## [Central Libraries]{.invert-font} {background-color="#000000" background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498243691581-b145c3f54a5a?q=80&w=3540&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" background-size="cover" background-position="center"}

. . .

[**Question:** Anybody an idea what a central library is?]{.invert-font .fragment}

:::{.footer}
:::

## Central Libraries

- [Book Delivery to Libraries]{.highlight} in Germany
- They supply **all local libraries** within the same state
- Complex, as the **number of libraries** per state can be large
- Books and media in the libraries **change often**
- Customers can **request books** from other libraries


## Structure of the Deliveries

- For delivery, central has [several employees and cars]{.highlight}
- Local libraries differ in size, some receive **more items**
- Items are **collected as well** during the tours[^tour-duration]
- They are **transported back** to the central library

[^tour-duration]: Due to regulations, the delivery tours cannot exceed a certain duration


## Potential Decisions

[Question]{.question}: **What decisions can the library make for tours?**

. . .

- Subdivide their set of libraries into **several ordered tours**
- Decide in **which order to visit** the libraries
- Evaluate **which car to use** for each of the tours
- Decide **which driver** to assign to each of the tours

## Impact of the Decisions

[Question]{.question}: **What is the impact of the decisions?**

. . .

- Longer driving routes [increase the footprint]{.highlight} of the deliveries
- Suboptimal tours can lead to **unnecessary costs**
- Fuel, personnel, and repairs **are increased**
- Unhappy customers due to **waiting times** on ordered books

# [Problem Structure]{.flow} {.title}

## Objective

[Question]{.question}: **What could be the objective for central libraries?**

. . .

- [Lowering costs]{.highlight} through improved tours
- Improvement of their **footprint** through shorter tours
- **Faster fulfillment** of the deliveries

## Modelling

[Question]{.question}: **What could we try to model?**

. . .

**Minimization** of the travel time while [supplying all libraries]{.highlight} in the state and adhering to **the vehicle capacities and driving time restrictions.**


## {.loud-slide}

Capacitated 

Vehicle Routing

(CVRP)
:::

::: footer
:::

## Vehicle Routing Problem

- CVRP is a **subproblem**
- Main problem is **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**
- Problem class about **designing routes for vehicle fleets**

. . .

:::{.callout-note}

There are many variants of the VRP! E.g., with time windows, periodic deliveries, allowing for pickups or deliveries, [and much more!]{.highlight}

:::


## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
Let's visualize 

the problem!

## Basic Problem Setting with Arcs

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_routing-basic-02.svg){width="99%"}


## Setting with Vehicles

## Basic Problem Setting with Tours

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_routing-basic-04.svg){width="99%"}

# [Problem Structure]{.flow} {.title}

## Available Sets

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the sets here?**

. . .

- $\mathcal{V}$ - Set of all nodes, index $i \in \{0,1,2,...,n\}$
- $\mathcal{A}$ - Set of all arcs between the nodes, index $(i,j) \in \mathcal{A}$
- $\mathcal{K}$ - Set of vehicles with identical capacity, index $k \in \mathcal{K}$
- $0 \in \mathcal{V}$ - Depot where the vehicles start

## Available Parameters

[Question:]{.question} **What are possible parameters?**

. . .

- $b$ - Capacity per vehicle
- $t$ - Maximal duration of each tour
- $d_i$ - Demand at node $i$
- $c_{i,j}$ - Travel time on an arc from $i$ to $j$

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}

$t$ is the maximal duration of each tour, not the travel time on an arc or an index!

:::

## Decision Variable(s)?

::: {.callout-note}
## We have the following sets:
  - All nodes, including the depot, $i \in \mathcal{V}$
  - All arcs between the nodes, $(i,j) \in \mathcal{A}$
  - The available vehicles, $k \in \mathcal{K}$
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## Our objective is to:
Minimize the **total travel time** while supplying **all customers** and adhering to the **vehicle capacities and duration restrictions**.
:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our decision variable/s?**

## Decision Variables

- $X_{i,j,k}$ - 1, if $k$ passes between $i$ and $j$ on its tour, 0 otherwise

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## Variable Domain

$X_{i,j,k}$ is a **binary variable**, as it can only take values 0 or 1. But most likely, you will already have spotted that!

:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Why this might make the problem difficult?**

## Decision Variable/s (again)?

::: {.callout-note}
## We have the following sets:
  - All nodes, including the depot, $i \in \mathcal{V}$
  - All arcs between the nodes, $(i,j) \in \mathcal{A}$
  - The available vehicles, $k \in \mathcal{K}$
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## Our objective is to:
Minimization of the travel time (or driving distance), while supplying all customers and adhering to the vehicle capacities and duration restrictions. **Hint:** Even with many vehicles, [each arc can maximally be passed once]{.highlight}!
:::

## Decision Variables (again)

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our decision variable/s?**

. . .


- $X_{i,j}$ - 1, if the arc between $i$ and $j$ is part of a tour, else 0

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## Only possible under certain conditions!
Only possible, if time and capacity constraints are equal for all vehicles!
:::

# [Model Formulation]{.flow} {.title}

## Objective Function?

::: {.callout-important}
## Our objective is to:

Minimization of the travel time (or driving distance), while supplying all customers and adhering to the vehicle capacities and duration restrictions.
:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our objective function?**

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following variable:

- $X_{i,j}$ - 1, if the arc between $i$ and $j$ is part of a tour, else 0

:::


## Objective Function

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following parameters:

- $c_{i,j}$ - travel time on an arc from $i$ to $j$

:::

. . .

$$\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{A}} c_{i,j} \times X_{i,j}$$

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What does $(i,j) \in \mathcal{A}$ under the sum mean?**


## Problem Constraints

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_routing-basic-04.svg){width="99%"}

## Constraints?

[Question:]{.question} **What constraints do we need?**

. . .

- Each customer has to be **visited once**
- The depot has to be **entered and left** $|\mathcal{K}|$ times
- We have to enforce the **capacity of our vehicles**
- We have to ensure the **maximal duration of each tour**

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## Subtours
In addition, we have to prevent **subtours**!

## Subtours

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_routing-basic-05.svg){width="99%"}

# [Constraints]{.flow} {.title}


## Visit Each Customer Once?

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of these constraints is to:
Ensure that each customer is visited exactly once. Essentially, we could also say that each node **has to be entered and left exactly once.**
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following sets and variables:

- $\mathcal{V}$ - Set of all nodes, index $i \in \{0,1,2,...,n\}$
- $X_{i,j}$ - 1, if the arc between $i$ and $j$ is part of a tour, 0 otherwise

:::

## Visit Each Customer Once


[Question:]{.question} **What could the constraint look like?**

. . .

$$
\sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} X_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall j \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}, i \neq j
$$

$$
\sum_{j \in \mathcal{V}} X_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}, i \neq j
$$

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Why for all nodes except the depot?**

. . .

The depot is the **only node** that is [visited multiple times!]{.highlight}


## Depot Entry and Exit Constraints?

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of these constraints is to:
Ensure that each vehicle enters and leaves the depot exactly $|\mathcal{K}|$ times, as we have $|\mathcal{K}|$ vehicles and each vehicle has to return to the depot.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following sets and variables:

- $\mathcal{V}$ - Set of all nodes, index $i \in \{0,1,2,...,n\}$
- $|\mathcal{K}|$ - Number of vehicles
- $X_{i,j}$ - 1, if the arc between $i$ and $j$ is part of a tour, 0 otherwise

:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could the constraint look like?**

## Depot Entry and Exit Constraints

$$
\sum_{i \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}} X_{i,0} = |\mathcal{K}|
$$

$$
\sum_{j \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}} X_{0,j} = |\mathcal{K}|
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## Are all constraints necessary?
No, theoretically we could also say that we only have to leave **or** enter the depot exactly $|\mathcal{K}|$ times, as the other constraint is already enforced by the "visit each customer once constraint".

# [Capacity and Subtour Elimination]{.flow} {.title}

The next ones are 

a little bit tricky.

## MTZ Formulation


::: {.incremental}
- **Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ)** Constraints
- Formulation by @KARA2004793
- Prevent subtours and **track routes** and **capacity utilization**
- First, we need [an additional variable!]{.highlight}
- $U_{i}$ - Capacity utilization at $i$ of vehicle on its tour with $i \in \mathcal{I}$
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}

You don't need to guess these constraints, as they are quite tricky!

:::

## MTZ Constraints

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following sets, parameters, and variables:

- $\mathcal{V}$ - Set of all nodes, index $i \in \{0,1,2,...,n\}$
- $X_{i,j}$ - 1, if the arc between $i$ and $j$ is part of a tour, 0 otherwise
- $U_{i}$ - Capacity utilization at $i$ of vehicle on its tour with $i \in \mathcal{I}$
- $b$ - Capacity per vehicle (all are identical!)
- $d_i$ - Demand at node $i$

:::

. . .

$$
U_i - U_j + b \times X_{i,j} \leq b - d_j \quad \forall i,j \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}, i \neq j
$$

. . .

$$
d_i \leq U_i \leq b \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}
$$

## {.loud-slide}

::: {.r-fit-text}

Too 

complicated?

:::

::: footer
:::

## Don't worry!

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_routing-subtours-01.svg){width="99%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}
- Let's [break it down!]{.highlight}
- $d_i$ for **all customers** is 1
- Capacity $b$ **per vehicle** is 5
- $U_i$ is the current **capacity utilization** at node $i \in \mathcal{I}$
:::

:::

## No connection between nodes

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_routing-subtours-01.svg){width="99%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}
- In case $X_{ij} = 0$:
  - $U_i - U_j \leq b - d_j$
  - **Non-binding** for relation between two nodes
- Following is [perfectly fine]{.highlight}:
  - $U_i \leq b$ and $U_j \geq d_j$
:::

:::

## Connection between two nodes

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_routing-subtours-01.svg){width="99%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}
- In case $X_{ij} = 1$:
  - $$U_i - U_j + b \leq b - d_j$$
  - **Binding** for relation between two nodes
- [Can be summarized to]{.highlight}:
  - $U_j \geq d_j + U_i$

:::

:::

## Connection in more detail

[Question:]{.question} **Why is it binding?**

. . .

- Binding as $U_j$ has to be **at least as large** as $d_i + U_i$
- Hence, fullfiled if the demand of $i$ is [added to the vehicle]{.highlight}

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Do you get the idea?**

. . .

- If $X_{ij} = 1$, then $U_j$ has to be **at least as large** as $d_i + U_i$
- If $X_{ij} = 0$, then $U_i \leq b$ and $U_j \geq d_j$

## Tour from the Depot

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_routing-subtours-03.svg){width="99%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}

- Tour of vehicle A ok
- Depot is the only node [visited multiple times]{.highlight}
- But the constraints are **not applied here!**

:::

## Tour on its Own

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_routing-subtours-04.svg){width="99%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}

- We drive to node $C$
- $U_C$ = 1

## Tour on its Own II

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_routing-subtours-05.svg){width="99%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}

- We continue to node $I$
- $U_I$ = 2

:::

:::

## Tour on its Own III

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_routing-subtours-06.svg){width="99%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}

- We continue to node $H$
- $U_H$ = 3
- Connection from $H$ to $C$
- $U_H$ is **greater** than $U_C$!
- [Infeasible solution!]{.highlight}

:::

:::

## Subtour Elimination

- Connection in the other direction wouldn't work as well
- **Only depot as "reset" **, as constraints are not applied here

[Question:]{.question} **What about the capacity?**

. . .

- Remember variable domain of $U_i$?
- $d_i \leq U_i \leq b$ → [Overall capacity limit enforced!]{.highlight}

# [Last Constraint]{.flow} {.title}

## Ensure time limit?

[Question:]{.question} **Anybody an idea?**

. . .

- Constraints basically **follow the same idea**!
- First, we again need an additional variable
- $T_{i}$ - Time spent on tour at the node $i$ of a vehicle with $i \in \mathcal{I}$

## Ensure time limit

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following sets and variables:

- $\mathcal{V}$ - Set of all nodes, index $i \in \{0,1,2,...,n\}$
- $X_{i,j}$ - 1, if the arc between $i$ and $j$ is part of a tour, 0 otherwise
- $T_{i}$ - Time spent on tour at the node $i$ of a vehicle with $i \in \mathcal{I}$
- $t$ - Maximal duration of a tour
- $c_{i,j}$ - Travel time on an arc from $i$ to $j$

:::

. . .

$$
T_i - T_j + t \times X_{i,j} \leq t - c_{i,j} \quad \forall i,j \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}, i \neq j
$$

. . .

$$
0 \leq T_{i} \leq t \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}
$$

# [Asymmetric Vehicle Routing Problem]{.flow} {.title}

## Objective

$$
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{A}} c_{i,j} \times X_{i,j} 
$$

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of the objective function is to:

Minimize the total travel distance.

:::

## Each customer is visited once

$$
\sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} X_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall j \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}, i \neq j
$$

$$
\sum_{j \in \mathcal{V}} X_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}, i \neq j
$$

::: {.callout-important}
## Our constraints ensure:

Each customer is visited exactly once.

:::

## Depot entry and exit

$$
\sum_{i \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}} X_{i,0} = |\mathcal{K}|
$$

$$
\sum_{j \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}} X_{0,j} = |\mathcal{K}|
$$

::: {.callout-important}
## Our constraints ensure:

The depot is visited by exactly $|\mathcal{K}|$ vehicles. Note, that we could remove one of the constraints and the solution would still be optimal.

:::

## Capacity and subtour elimination

$$
U_i - U_j + b \times X_{i,j} \leq b - d_j \quad \forall i,j \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}, i \neq j
$$

$$
d_i \leq U_i \leq b \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}
$$

::: {.callout-important}
## Our constraints ensure:

The capacity limit is respected and subtours are eliminated.

:::

## Time constraints

$$
T_i - T_j + t \times X_{i,j} \leq t - c_{i,j} \quad \forall i,j \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}, i \neq j
$$

$$
0 \leq T_i \leq t \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}
$$

::: {.callout-important}
## Our constraints ensure:

The time limit is respected (and subtours are eliminated).

:::

## Variables

$$
X_{i,j} \in \{0,1\} \quad \forall i,j \in \mathcal{V}
$$

$$
d_i \leq U_i \leq b \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}
$$

$$
0 \leq T_i \leq t \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{0\}

::: {.callout-important}
## The variable domains make sure that:

The binary setup variable is either 0 or 1 and the new variables are below the time and capacity limit.
