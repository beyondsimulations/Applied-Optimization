## FAQs

### Is the course difficult?

In terms of difficulty, this is of course somehow complicated for me to assess. However, I have tried to make all the content as comprehensible as possible and really do ask you many questions in the lectures. If I have the impression that something has not been understood at all, then I take longer at that point. This semester is the first time I think the course is truly finished. I have adapted the slides based on feedback from the last two years and made all the examples as simple as possible.
**In a nutshell**: If you are interested in the subject and equations do not scare you, you will likely do great in the course.

### How can I download PDF slides from the lecture?

1.  First, open the lecture you want to download the slides from.
2.  Then, click on the `RevealJS` button in the top right corner.
3.  Now, click on the three stacked bars in the lower left corner.
4.  Then, click on `Tools` in the upper left corner.
5.  Now you can select `PDF Export Mode` and then save the slides as a PDF.

## How does the calculation of the bonus points work?

To reach the full 6 points, all exercises must be submitted. A maximum of 0.5 points can be earned per exercise. In the overview, '1' stands for successfully submitted, and '0.5' for submitted (but without attempting to solve everything). In the end, I calculate this as half or quarter points towards the total score.

## Can I take a sheet with me to the exam?

Yes, you can take a DIN A4 sheet with notes on both sides to the exam. Please note, that it should be **one** sheet of paper.

## How does the chatbot work?

The course AI is a chatbot that uses the [Mistral](https://mistral.ai) and some custom code hosted on Hetzner in Germany. If you have any questions about the course, feel free to ask the AI. Note, that the AI is not perfect and sometimes the answers might be incorrect. For more information about how the data is processed, please refer to the [privacy policy](privacy.qmd).
