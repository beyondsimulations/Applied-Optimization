# <span class="flow">Introduction</span>

## Congratulations!

# Solutions

You will likely find solutions to most exercises online. However, I strongly encourage you to work on these exercises independently without searching explicitly for the exact answers to the exercises. Understanding someone else's solution is very different from developing your own. Use the lecture notes and try to solve the exercises on your own. This approach will significantly enhance your learning and problem-solving skills.

Remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with different approaches, and don't hesitate to ask for clarification during class discussions.

You've finished the course and learned how mathematical models can be used to solve real-world problems! :tada:

## 

Any questions

regarding the

past lectures?

## What have we learned?

-   How to **identify and abstract** real-world problems
-   How to **start programming** in Julia
-   How to **model and solve** optimization problems
-   How to **question** model assumptions

. . .

> **Tip**
>
> That's a lot and a great foundation for a seminar or a master thesis!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span class="flow">How to continue?</span>

## How to continue after the lecture?

-   The best way is to <span class="highlight">keep programming and modeling</span>
-   We are offering **seminars and master thesis**
-   Try to find a way to **apply programming in your work**
-   There are **many interesting topics** to explore!

. . .

> **Tip**
>
> Getting your supervisors on board is the hardest part! But note, that it is often worth it and the tools we have used are all free and open-source.

## Concrete Next Steps

-   Join online communities on Julia and Optimization
-   Contribute to open-source projects if you can
-   Follow key researchers and practitioners
-   Start a small personal project using the tools learned

. . .

> **Tip**
>
> If you want to start a small personal project, try to find a problem that you are interested in and that you can solve using the tools we have learned.

## Start Pair Programming with AI

-   First, try to <span class="highlight">be confident with the basics</span> of a language
-   Always try to <span class="highlight">understand the code you use</span>
-   If you want to try **AI pair programming**, use Cursor as IDE

. . .

> **Tip**
>
> Cursor is a great IDE for AI pair programming, although it is not completely free. It has Claude and ChatGPT integrated and makes work much easier when compared to copying and pasting code.

# <span class="flow">Final Words</span>

## That's it for the Lecture Series!

-   I hope you **enjoyed** the lecture and found it **helpful**
-   On Friday, we will have a <span class="highlight">discussion session</span>
-   You can earn the **last half-bonus point** for the exam
-   I wish you **all the best for your studies and your career!**
