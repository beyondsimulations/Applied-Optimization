# <span class="flow">Introduction</span>

## <span class="invert-font">Islamic Pilgrimage</span>

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Have you ever heard of the Hajj?**

## The Hajj

-   **The great Islamic pilgrimage towards Mecca**
-   The holy city is the **religious center** of the Islamic religion
-   Located in the **Kingdom of Saudi Arabia**
-   Each physically able Muslim should **perform Hajj once**
-   <span class="highlight">Confined spaces</span> around the holy sites
-   Only **few million** people are annually allowed

## Mina Tent City

## The scope of the Hajj

-   Pilgrimage is actually a <span class="highlight">multi-day journey</span>
-   Involves a number of **different rituals at several ritual sites**
-   Our efforts focused on the **Rhamy-Al-Jamarat ritual**

. . .

> **Rhamy-Al-Jamarat ritual**
>
> Pilgrims throw pebbles against three pillars, which symbolize the temptations of the devil. They repeat this ritual with small variations on four consecutive days.

## <span class="invert-font">Mina Tent City</span>

-   1.5--2 million people reside in the tent city
-   Pilgrims repeatedly access the holy site
-   Perform the Rhamy-Al-Jamarat ritual
-   Walk through a network of streets and pathways
-   Later proceed to the Kaaba or return to the camp

## Time Preferences

-   <span class="highlight">When to perform the ritual on each of the four days?</span>
-   Pilgrims have different **time preferences**
    -   Constrained by **arrival and departure** shuttle times
    -   Extremely **hot at midday** quickly leading to exhaustion
    -   Traditions play an **important role** in time preferences

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could become a problem?**

## Risk: Overcrowding at Mina

-   In aggregation, the time preferences are **clustered**
-   **Popular peak times** dating back to the Prophet Mohammad
-   Equates to a <span class="highlight">city-scale crowd of millions of people</span>
-   Accessing **one central place** within only a few hours

. . .

> **Caution**
>
> **Uncoordinated** access within confined area can **escalate into crowd disasters**!

## Crowd Accidents

-   **Historical incidents** of crowd disasters
-   Resulted in **casualties and injuries**
-   **High-density bottlenecks** on the way to the rituals
-   Several <span class="highlight">critical points of congestion</span>
-   Waiting times can lead to **hazardous conditions**

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could we do to prevent this?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span class="flow">Pedestrian Traffic</span>

## 

How is Hajj pedestrian

traffic different from the

regular urban pedestrian

traffic in cities?

## Pedestrian Traffic

<img src="https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-pedtraf-1.png" style="width:100.0%" />

-   Individuals and groups
-   Multitude of destinations
-   Mixing and formation
-   Distractions

<img src="https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-pedtraf-2.jpg" style="width:100.0%" />

-   Homogeneous groups
-   Shared destination
-   Higher densities
-   Predictable

## Types of Pedestrian Flow

<img src="https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-unidirectional_flow.png" style="width:30.0%" alt="1." />
<img src="https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-bidirectional_crossing_flow.png" style="width:30.0%" alt="2." />
<img src="https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-multidirectional_crossing_flow.png" style="width:30.0%" alt="3." />

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What is the most dangerous type here?**

. . .

> **Caution**
>
> **Multi-directional and intersecting flows** are the most dangerous type!

## Pilgrim Flows

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-jamarat_flow.png)

> **General idea**
>
> Adhere to **one-way flow systems** and define path options for each camp under consideration of a unidirectional flow system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span class="flow">Problem Structure</span>

## Objective?

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be the objective?**

-   Minimize <span class="highlight">risk of overcrowding and accidents</span>
-   **Enable ritual participation** of all pilgrims
-   **Satisfy time preferences** of pilgrims
-   **Easy plans to execute** under pressure

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **How can we try to model this?**

## Objective

-   Satisfy <span class="highlight">time preferences as much as possible</span>
-   Consideration of **infrastructure bottleneck flow capacities**
-   **Maximize safety** for all pilgrims
-   **Simple plans** to make the execution as simple as possible
-   This can **prevent critical errors** later on!

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Where is the goal conflict?**

## Goal Conflict

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-goalconflict.png)

## Basic Structure

-   We follow the structure of a **simple scheduling problem**
-   The aim is to "assign" something to **different time periods**
-   We assign <span class="highlight">time slots to groups using different paths</span>
-   Plans are kept simpler by assigning **paths to camps**
-   Assignments are **fixed over the entire time horizon**

## Pilgrim Routes

Each camp has a set of feasible one-way paths that include the stoning ritual.

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-m_a.svg)

## Pilgrim Routes

Path may contain one or more bottlenecks, regarded as resources subject to a capacity.

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-m_b.svg)

## Pilgrim Routes

Pilgrims departure from a camp at a time $x$ and pass through the bottleneck later.

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-m_c.svg)

## Pilgrim Routes

Our model should assign one of the feasible paths to a camp on all four ritual days.

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-m_d.svg)

## Pilgrim Routes

These bottlenecks should not be overcrowded at any time during the Hajj.

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-m_e.svg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 

How can we model

time preferences?

## Time Preferences

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-solap-1.png)

## Time preference satisfaction

-   Assign **one departure time slot**
-   Assigned per ritual day to each pilgrim group
-   <span class="highlight">Minimize difference between assigned and preferred time</span>
-   Different **penalty functions** are possible

. . .

> **Group time preferences**
>
> May be computed, i.e., down-sampled given a distribution of pilgrims over time.

## Penalty Functions

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-satisfaction.svg)

## Fluctuations

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could become a problem?**

. . .

-   If allowed demand between periods **varies strongly**, accidents are **more likely to happen!**
-   We need keep the <span class="highlight">changes between periods within bounds</span>

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Any idea how we can do that later?**

. . .

-   Restrict the change of the utilization **between periods**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals Summarized

1.  Satisfy **time preferences of the pilgrims** as much as possible under the consideration of **infrastructure bottleneck flow capacities** by assigning "something" to a time slot.
2.  For the sake of **simplicity and safety**, pilgrims coming from one camp will always have to be assigned **the same path**.
3.  We need to keep track of the **relative utilization** of each resource **to restrict the fluctuations** between periods to ensure a safer event.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span class="flow">Model Formulation</span>

## Sets?

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be the sets here?**

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-m_e.svg)

## Sets

-   $\mathcal{T}$ - Stoning periods in ascending order, indexed by $t$
-   $\mathcal{R}$ - Infrastructure resources, indexed by $r$
-   $\mathcal{C}$ - Pilgrim camps, indexed by $c$
-   $\mathcal{P}$ - Paths that include the stoning, indexed by $p$
-   $\mathcal{S}$ - Scheduling groups, indexed by $s$

. . .

<span class="task">But we further need subsets!</span>

## Subsets

-   $\mathcal{S}_c$ - Scheduling groups in camp $c$
-   $\mathcal{S}_p$ - Scheduling groups that can use path $p$
-   $\mathcal{P}_c$ - Feasible paths for camp $c$
-   $\mathcal{P}_s$ - Feasible paths for group $s$
-   $\mathcal{P}_r$ - Paths that contain the resource $r$
-   $\mathcal{T}_s$ - Available stoning periods for scheduling group $s$

## 

That looks

complicated...

## On Subsets

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Why use subsets?**

. . .

-   It may seem **like a lot**
-   But it also <span class="highlight">really helps a lot!</span>
-   We **reduce the problem size**

. . .

> **Tip**
>
> A smaller problem size **reduces the solution space** and **helps the solver** in finding the optimal solution faster!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Parameters?

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be possible parameters?**

. . .

-   $n_s$ - Number of pilgrims in scheduling group $s$
-   $f_{s,t}$ - Penalty value of assigning period $t$ to group $s$
-   $a_{p,r}$ - Offset between stoning and utilization period of $r$ on $p$
-   $b_{r,t}$ - Capacity of resource $r$ in period $t$
-   $\sigma_r$ - max. relative utilization deviation between $t$ for $r$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## First Decision Variable?

> **Our first goal is to:**
>
> Satisfy time preferences of the pilgrims as much as possible under the consideration of infrastructure bottleneck flow capacities by assigning "something" to a time slot.

. . .

> **We need the following sets:**
>
> -   Scheduling groups, $s \in \mathcal{S}$
> -   Stoning periods in ascending order, $t \in \mathcal{T}$
> -   Paths that include the stoning of the devil, $p \in \mathcal{P}$

## First Decision Variable

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be our decision variable?**

. . .

-   $X_{s,t,p}$ - 1, if scheduling group $s$ is scheduled to perform stoning in period $t$ and to use path $p$, 0 otherwise.

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Do you get the idea here?**

. . .

It's a **binary assignment** of a group to a time slot and a path.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Second Decision Variable?

> **Our second goal (more a constraint):**
>
> For the sake of **simplicity and safety**, pilgrims coming from one camp will always have to be assigned the same path.

. . .

> **We need the following sets:**
>
> -   Pilgrim camps from which groups can depart, $c \in \mathcal{C}$
> -   Paths that include the stoning of the devil, $p \in \mathcal{P}$

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be our second variable?**

## Second Decision Variable

-   $Y_{c,p}$ - 1, if camp $c$ is assigned to use path $p$, 0 otherwise

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Does anyone remember the third part?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Third Decision Variable?

> **Our third goal (again, more a constraint):**
>
> We need to keep track of the relative utilization of each resource to restrict the fluctuations between periods to ensure a safer event.

. . .

> **We need the following sets:**
>
> -   Infrastructure resources, $r \in \mathcal{R}$
> -   Stoning periods in ascending order, $t \in \mathcal{T}$

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be our third variable?**

## Third Decision Variable

-   $U_{r,t}$ - Relative utilization of $r$ in $t$ with $0 \leq U_{rt} \leq 1$

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What does relative utilization mean?**

. . .

-   It's a **percentage** of the capacity usage of the resource
-   **Normalizes** the capacities between different resources

## 

Let's start with our

objective function!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Objective Function?

> **Our main objective is to:**
>
> Satisfy time preferences of the pilgrims as much as possible under the consideration of infrastructure bottleneck flow capacities by assigning "something" to a time slot. **Hint:** We thus could aim to minimize the total dissatisfaction with the timetable.

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **How could we minimize the total dissatisfaction?**

-   **Penalize** difference between assigned and preferred time
-   Different penalty functions, e.g., linear, quadratic, etc.

## Objective Function

> **We need the following parameters and variables:**
>
> -   $f_{s,t}$ - Penalty value of assigning period $t$ to group $s$
> -   $X_{s,t,p}$ - 1 if group $s$ is scheduled to perform stoning in $t$ and to use $p$, 0 otherwise

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be our objective function?**

. . .

$$
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}}\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}}\sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}} f_{s,t} \times X_{s,t,p}
$$

## Objective Function Characteristics

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Is our objective function linear?**

. . .

-   We can use **non-linear penalty functions**
-   But still, it will always be **linear**

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Anybody an idea why?**

. . .

-   We can compute the **penalties in advance**
-   Do **not** depend on the decision variables

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span class="flow">Constraints</span>

## Constraints needed?

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-model_flow.svg)

## Key Constraints

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Which constraints do we need?**

1.  Each group must have <span class="highlight">one path assigned</span>
2.  Each camp must have <span class="highlight">one path assigned</span>
3.  Each group must have <span class="highlight">one time slot assigned</span>
4.  Each resource must have <span class="highlight">a capacity limit</span>
5.  Constraint the <span class="highlight">relative utilization between periods</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assign Paths to Camps

> **The goal of this constraint is to:**
>
> Assign **one path to each camp** over the entire time horizon.

. . .

> **We need the following variables:**
>
> -   $Y_{c,p}$ - 1 if camp $c$ is assigned to use path $p$, 0 otherwise

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be the constraint?**

$$
\sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}_c} Y_{c,p} = 1 \quad \forall c \in \mathcal{C}
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assign Time Slots to Groups?

> **The goal of this constraint is to:**
>
> Assign **one time slot to each group** over the entire time horizon **using the same path** we have assigned to the camp in the previous constraint.

. . .

> **We need the following variables:**
>
> -   $X_{s,t,p}$ - 1 if group $s$ is scheduled to perform stoning in $t$ and to use $p$, 0 otherwise
> -   $Y_{c,p}$ - 1 if camp $c$ is assigned to use path $p$, 0 otherwise

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be the constraint?**

## Assign Time Slots to Groups

$$
\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_s} X_{s,t,p}  = Y_{c,p} \quad  \forall c \in \mathcal{C}, p \in \mathcal{P}_c, s \in \mathcal{S}_c
$$

. . .

> **We use the following sets:**
>
> -   $\mathcal{C}$ - Pilgrim camps
> -   $\mathcal{S}_c$ - Scheduling groups in camp $c$
> -   $\mathcal{T}_s$ - Available stoning periods for scheduling group $s$
> -   $\mathcal{P}_c$ - Feasible paths for camp $c$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Relative Utilization and Capacities

> **The goal of this constraint is to:**
>
> Compute the relative utilization of each resource while also ensuring that the utilization does not exceed the capacity limit. <span class="highlight">This one is very tricky!</span>

. . .

<span class="highlight">Difficulties:</span>

-   Includes the time-shift between stoning and utilization
-   Used as parameter to shift periods in variable $X_{s,t,p}$

## Compute Relative Utilization?

> **We need the following:**
>
> -   $n_s$ - Number of pilgrims in scheduling group $s$
> -   $a_{p,r}$ - Period offset between stoning period and utilization period of $r$ on $p$
> -   $b_{r,t}$ - Capacity of resource $r$ in period $t$ in number of pilgrims
> -   $X_{s,t,p}$ - 1, if $s$ is scheduled to perform stoning in $t$ and to use $p$, 0 else
> -   $U_{r,t}$ - Relative utilization of resource $r$ in period $t$ with $0 \leq U_{r,t} \leq 1$

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be the constraint?**

## Compute Relative Utilization

$$
\sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}_r}\sum_{s \in S_p} n_s \times X_{s,t-a_{p,r},p}  = b_{r,t}\times U_{r,t} \quad \forall r \in \mathcal{R}, t \in \mathcal{T}
$$

. . .

> **We use the following:**
>
> -   $n_s$ - Number of pilgrims in scheduling group $s$
> -   $a_{p,r}$ - Period offset between stoning period and utilization period of $r$ on $p$
> -   $b_{r,t}$ - Capacity of resource $r$ in period $t$ in number of pilgrims
> -   $X_{s,t,p}$ - 1, if $s$ is scheduled to perform stoning in $t$ and to use $p$, 0 else
> -   $U_{r,t}$ - Relative utilization of resource $r$ in period $t$ with $0 \leq U_{r,t} \leq 1$

## 

Let's pause!

Have you understood

this part?

## How does the shift work?

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-model_flow.svg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Keep Fluctuations within Bounds?

> **The goal of this constraint is to:**
>
> Keep the relative utilization of each resource within bounds to ensure a safer event.

. . .

> **We need the following:**
>
> -   $\sigma_r$ - max. relative utilization deviation between $t$ for $r$
> -   $U_{r,t}$ - Relative utilization of resource $r$ in period $t$ with $0 \leq U_{rt} \leq 1$

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be the constraint?**

## Keep Fluctuations within Bounds

$$
U_{r,t} - U_{r,t-1} \leq \sigma_r \quad \forall (r,t) \in \left| \mathcal{R}\times \mathcal{T}\right|
$$

$$
U_{r,t-1} - U_{r,t} \leq \sigma_r \quad \forall (r,t) \in \left| \mathcal{R}\times \mathcal{T}\right|
$$

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Can somebody explain why this works?**

-   Each constraint limits the **change**
-   The first one limits the **increase**
-   The second one limits the **decrease**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scheduling Problem I

subject to:

## Scheduling Problem II

> **Note**
>
> Restricting the **relative utilization** of each resource to a certain bound.

## Scheduling Problem III

> **Note**
>
> All variables, except for $U_{r,t}$, are binary.
