# [Course Structure]{.flow} {.title}

## Lectures

- Every Tuesday between 10.15 AM and 11.45 AM
- First four lectures repeat modelling and programming
- Later lectures discuss practical problems and implementation
- Lectures are interactive → We discuss approaches!
- Communication takes place via E-Mail

## Tutorials

- Tutorials every Friday between 8.15 AM and 9.45 AM
- In these tutorials we are working on assignments
- Please bring a laptop with Windows, macOS, or Linux!
- This Friday there is **no tutorial**!

## Assignments
- Based on applied problems of the lecture
- Up to 3 students can solve assignments together
- Submitted solutions earn bonus points for the exam
- Max. 0.5 point per tutorial

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
Bonus points only count if the mark is at least 4.0!

[Question:]{.question} Have you ever heard of Julia?

## Why Julia?

- **Designed to be:**   
    - as general as Python
    - as statistics-friendly as R
    - as fast as C++!

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
**Allows for fast data workflows**, particularly in scientific computing!
:::

## Syntax

- Dynamically-typed syntax just like Python
- Similar to R, Matlab and Python - **not like C++**
- In comparison, accessible and easy to learn!
- **No need to worry about memory management!**

## JuMP

- Package for **algebraic modeling** in Julia
- Simplifies solving complex optimization problems
- Provides a high-level, user-friendly interface
- Useful for operations research and data science

## Must it be a new language?

- Yes, but no need to worry!
- It is similar to Python and R
- We will learn the syntax together in the first part
- It is helpful to switch languages from time to time
