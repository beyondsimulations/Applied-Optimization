# Programming Language

## Julia Programming Language {#pic_julia}

In this lecture we are going to work in the Julia Programming Language.

![](images/julia-programming-language.png){width=50%}

Here are the main reasons we will use it:

## Julia Programming Language

- **Speed:** Julia was designed to be as general as Python, as statistics-friendly as R, but as fast as C++. This focus on speed allows for fast data workflows, particularly in scientific computing.

## Julia Programming Language

- **Syntax:** Despite its high-performance, Julia has a dynamically-typed syntax that is more similar to R, Matlab and Python, making it accessible and easy to learn compared to more complex programming languages.

## Julia Programming Language

- **JuMP:** Julia's seamless integration with JuMP simplifies the process of solving complex optimization problems. It provides a high-level, user-friendly interface for modeling and solving linear and nonlinear optimization problems, making it a valuable tool for operations research, data science, and engineering applications.

# Algebraic Modelling

## {.standout}

Do you have experience with algebraic modeling?

## {.standout}

What is an algebraic model?

## Algebraic Modeling

### How to learn algebraic modeling?

- Practice, practice, and practice!
- Understand standard models and apply their approach to other problems
- Develop an understanding that the constraints of the algebraic model describe the admissible solution space
- Use an available standard algorithm to determine an (optimal) solution

## Algebraic Modeling

### Central Questions

- What is to be decided?
- What is relevant to the decision?
- What information is given and relevant?
- What parameters (data) are needed?
- Which variables and of which type are needed?

### Model Components

1. Objective function
2. Constraints
3. Variables

## Linear Optimization Model

### Basic Model Formulation

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{maximize} \quad F = \sum_{j\in \mathcal{J}} c_j \times X_j
\end{align}
$$

subject to

$$
\begin{align}
&\sum_{j\in \mathcal{J}} a_{i,j} \times X_j  \le b_i && \forall i \in \mathcal{I} \\
&X_j \ge 0 &&  \forall  j \in \mathcal{J} 
\end{align}
$$

## Graphs

We can model and illustrate many problems with graphs (networks).

### Undirected Graph

System $(N,E)$ with non-empty node set $N = \{1,...,n \}$ and
an **edge** set $E = \left\{e_1,e_2,...,e_m \right\}$.
:::

- The graph $G=(N,E)$ consists of 2 sets $N$ and $E$
- The edge set consists of 2-element subsets of the node set
- $e_k = \{i_k,j_k \}, k=1,...m$ with $i_k,j_k \in N$
- Designation of edge elements in models: $e \in E$ or $\{i,j\}\in E$.
- Nodes $i$ and $j$ in $e=\{i,j\}$ are called endpoints of the edge

## Graphs

### Directed Graph

System $(N,A)$ with non-empty node set $N = \{1,...,n \}$ and
an **arc** set $A = \left\{a_1,a_2,...,a_m \right\}$ 
:::

- The graph $G=(N,A)$ consists of 2 sets $N$ and $A$
- Edges have an orientation (start and end nodes)
- The edge $a=(i,j)$ is different from $a'=(j,i)$
- Very common in logistics
- Directed edge: also 'arrow' or 'arc' (hence the set is called $A$)

# First Applied Case

## Solar Panel Transport

A company is producing solar panels in Dresden and Laupheim and has to transport them to new solar farms near Hamburg, Munich, and Berlin. The quantities offered and demanded (truckloads) and the transport costs per truckload in Euro are as follows:

| Origin/Destination | Hamburg | Munich | Berlin | Available |
|--------------------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Dresden            | 5010    | 4640   | 1980   | 34        |
| Laupheim           | 7120    | 1710   | 6430   | 41        |
| Demand             | 21      | 17     | 29     |           |

Example: a truckload from Dresden ($i=1$) to Munich ($j=2$) costs $c_{12}=4640$ Euro. Moreover, it is necessary to fulfil all customer demands, as the contract has already been signed.

### What could be the objective?

. . .

Minimizing the transport costs over all truckloads while meeting the demand based on the available solar panels adhering to the available panels.
