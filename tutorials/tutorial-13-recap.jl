# # Tutorial XIII - Recap and Discussion
#
# Applied Optimization with Julia
#
# # Introduction
#
# This will (hopefully) be the easiest tutorial of the entire course.
# Essentially, we will just use today’s tutorial as a last chance for you
# to ask questions and discuss the content of the course.
#
# # Feedback on the lecture series
#
# To receive half a bonus point, you will just need to complete a short
# feedback form on the lecture series before the exam. It is not from the
# university, but from me, and I would be truly grateful for your honest
# opinion and feedback. Your feedback is important to me and has
# absolutely no influence on your grade! In total I think it will take you
# about 15 - 20 minutes to complete the form - that’s not too bad given
# that you will receive half a bonus point for it, right?
#
# In all honesty, I know this is much to ask of you - especially given
# that the exams are coming up. However, I think it is very important for
# me to get your honest opinion and feedback. I will use it to improve the
# course for future students, as well as for my future teaching.
