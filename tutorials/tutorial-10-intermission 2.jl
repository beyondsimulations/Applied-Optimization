# # Tutorial X - Intermission: Exam Preparation
#
# Applied Optimization with Julia
#
# # Introduction
#
# This tutorial is another short intermission to give you an idea of the
# structure of the exam. You can hand in your answers at the end to
# receive half a **bonus point**, if at least 75 % of the answers are
# correct and you describe your work clearly. If you have any questions or
# suggestions on how to improve the structure of the exam, please ask
# them.
#
# The exam is just meant to be a **tool** to check your understanding of
# the material and to give you a chance to show your skills. It is not
# meant to be a stressful event or a punishment. If you have followed the
# course and put in the effort, you should be able to pass the exam with a
# good grade.
#
# > **Tip**
# >
# > As some of these tasks are difficult to answer on a computer, you can
# > hand in your answer scanned or written digitally on an iPad or Laptop.

#
# As temperatures rise due to global warming, so does the demand for ice
# cream. The ice cream company was amazed by your transportation plan from
# the lecture and asked if you could help with their production plan.
#
# The company wants to optimize its production to keep up with the
# customer demand. To do so, they offer different flavors of ice cream
# that are made and stored in a warehouse. Each flavor has a unique
# production time per unit of ice cream and no setup time for the
# production. In the first period, the company has 100 units of each
# flavor in storage at the end of the period.
#
# Furthermore, each setup of a different flavor costs a fixed amount of
# money identical for all flavors and periods, while the ice cream storage
# costs in the warehouse are different for each flavor but identical for
# all periods. These storage costs occur at the end of each period per
# unit of ice cream for all units not sold to cover the varying demand per
# flavor and period.
#
# Each period matches a shift length of a certain number of hours,
# identical for all periods. The objective is to minimize the total cost
# of production and storage while satisfying all demands and production
# capacities.
#
# Define all sets, parameters and variables required to model the problem
# described above. Select a suitable notation of your choice. Make sure to
# explicitly state in your notation which elements are sets, parameters
# and variables.
#
# > **Tip**
# >
# > Note that the problem does not have to be modeled yet!

# ## 1.e (9 Points)
#
# Due to the success of the companies, workers demand higher wages and a
# compensation for working overtime. Your task is to extend the model to
# reflect this new situation. In the future, each worked hour in a period
# has a fixed cost per shift hour, identical for all periods. If the
# production time in one period exceeds the shift-length, workers have to
# work overtime. For each hour working overtime, the fixed costs per hour
# are 50% higher than usual. Furthermore, more than an additional time of
# a half a shift length is not allowed due to legal reasons.
#
# How can you expand your model to reflect this new situation? Write down
# all additional or modified sets, parameters, variables, constraints and
# the objective function while describing each with a few words.
#

# $p \in 1:P$ which must be non-negative and has an upper bound stored in
# parameter `capacity[t,p]`. All parameters (`T`, `P`, `capacity`) are
