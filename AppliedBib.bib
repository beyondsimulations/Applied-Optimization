	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.4740208},
	abstract = {The 2022 FIFA World Cup, primarily hosted in Doha, Qatar, presented unique logistical challenges, especially during the group stage when up to four matches were scheduled daily. The close proximity of all locations exerted considerable strain on the city's transportation infrastructure, impacting not just match visitors but also those participating in parallel public events and festivals. A nuanced understanding of the full spectrum of transportation demand during the event was essential for developing transportation plans that prioritise accessibility, sustainability, and safety.

This paper presents a newly developed, scalable and comprehensive transportation demand simulation coupled with a passenger counting and inflow control mechanism, focused on metro systems to approximate and manage the transportation demand during large-scale events. The simulation is data-driven and highly adaptable, encompassing several categories of participants including tourists, the local workforces, and residents. Various large and publicly available data sets are employed in the simulation framework to construct an accurate representation of the local population, event venues, transport hubs, accommodation options, and tourist attractions. Furthermore, the simulation takes into account an array of variables such as the current load on transportation networks and event venues, and a mode selection based on choice models.

In operation, our simulation effectively identified bottlenecks leading to delays and potential overloads across metro system segments, tourist hotspots, and event locations in preparation for the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. Using these insights, we devised targeted mitigation strategies and integrated them back into the simulation model to assess their impact. The results offered valuable guidance for policymakers and transportation planners, contributing to the overall safety and efficiency of the FIFA World Cup 2022.},

              We propose a new framework to address the territory design problem of emergency services in collaboration with two police authorities in Europe. Our framework serves as a strategic decision support system to assess different districting layouts, department locations, staffing decisions and dispatching strategies. First, we introduce a novel modification of the
              p
              -median problem with a combined approach to the contiguity and compactness of district layouts solvable by a commercial solver. Second, we utilize a new discrete event simulation that accounts for the variability of spatial and temporal incident patterns and driving times to evaluate the district layouts according to several criteria based upon up to 1.8 million historical incidents. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed district layouts can lead to a reduction of the response time by up to 14.52\% while also lowering the dispatch time, the overall driving time, and the number of unanswered calls for service. Additionally, we examine the computational complexity of optimally locating district centers and analyze the more restricted problem of optimally reassigning districts to fixed district centers.},

abstract = {The Miller–Tucker–Zemlin (MTZ) Subtour Elimination Constraints (SECs) and the improved version by Desrochers and Laporte (DL) have been and are still in regular use to model a variety of routing problems. This paper presents a systematic way of deriving inequalities that are more complicated than the MTZ and DL inequalities and that, in a certain way, “generalize” the underlying idea of the original inequalities. We present a polyhedral approach that studies and analyses the convex hull of feasible sets for small dimensions. This approach allows us to generate generalizations of the MTZ and DL inequalities, which are “good” in the sense that they define facets of these small polyhedra. It is well known that DL inequalities imply a subset of Dantzig–Fulkerson–Johnson (DFJ) SECs for two-node subsets. Through the approach presented, we describe a generalization of these inequalities which imply DFJ SECs for three-node subsets and show that generalizations for larger subsets are unlikely to exist. Our study presents a similar analysis with generalizations of MTZ inequalities and their relation with the lifted circuit inequalities for three node subsets.}

abstract = {In this paper we review the exact algorithms based on the branch and bound approach proposed in the last years for the solution of the basic version of the vehicle routing problem (VRP), where only the vehicle capacity constraints are considered. These algorithms have considerably increased the size of VRPs that can be solved with respect to earlier approaches. Moreover, at least for the case in which the cost matrix is asymmetric, branch and bound algorithms still represent the state-of-the-art with respect to the exact solution. Computational results comparing the performance of different relaxations and algorithms on a set of benchmark instances are presented. We conclude by examining possible future directions of research in this field.}
