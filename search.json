Implement both parameters for the cost of setup and the inventory holding cost in the model. Call them setupHourCosts and warehouseCosts.\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\nNext, you need to prepare the given data for the model. Create a dictionary for the available time, bottling time, and setup time. Call them dictAvailableTime, dictBottlingTime, and dictSetupTime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s understand what’s happening with dictDemand in the code. It creates a dictionary where:\n\nKeys are tuples (beer_type, period), e.g., (\"IPA\", \"week_1\")\nValues are the demand numbers for that beer in that period\n\nYou can use this pattern to create dictionaries for:\n\ndictAvailableTime: Maps each period (single key) → available time\ndictBottlingTime: Maps each beer type (single key) → bottling time per bottle\ndictSetupTime: Maps each beer type (single key) → setup time\n\nNotice that these dictionaries have single keys (just the period or just the beer type), not tuple keys like dictDemand.\n\n\n\n\n# Prepare the data for the model\ndictDemand = Dict((row.beer_type,row.period) =&gt; row.demand for row in eachrow(demandCustomers))\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\nCode\n# Validate your solution\n@assert length(dictAvailableTime) == nrow(availableTime) \"Available time dictionary should have same length as input data\"\n@assert length(dictBottlingTime) == nrow(bottlingTime) \"Bottling time dictionary should have same length as input data\"\n@assert length(dictSetupTime) == nrow(setupTime) \"Setup time dictionary should have same length as input data\"\n\n# Check that all values are positive\n@assert all(v -&gt; v &gt; 0, values(dictAvailableTime)) \"All available time values must be positive\"\n@assert all(v -&gt; v &gt; 0, values(dictBottlingTime)) \"All bottling time values must be positive\"\n@assert all(v -&gt; v &gt; 0, values(dictSetupTime)) \"All setup time values must be positive\"\n\n# Check that dictionaries contain all expected keys\n@assert all(p -&gt; haskey(dictAvailableTime, p), availableTime.period) \"Missing periods in available time dictionary\"\n@assert all(b -&gt; haskey(dictBottlingTime, b), bottlingTime.beer_type) \"Missing beer types in bottling time dictionary\"\n@assert all(b -&gt; haskey(dictSetupTime, b), setupTime.beer_type) \"Missing beer types in setup time dictionary\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we define the model instance for the CLSP.\n\n# Prepare the model instance\nlotsizeModel = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)\nset_attribute(lotsizeModel, \"presolve\", \"on\")\nset_time_limit_sec(lotsizeModel, 60.0)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, create your variables. Please name them productBottled for the binary variable, productQuantity for the production quantity and WarehouseStockPeriodEnd for the warehouse stock at the end of each period. We will use these names later in the code to plot the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating your variables, you’ll have to create one variable for each combination of beer type and period. You can use the dictionary keys directly in the variable definition:\n@variable(model, x[keys(dictBottlingTime), keys(dictAvailableTime)])\nThis creates variables indexed by:\n\nFirst index: beer types (from dictBottlingTime)\nSecond index: periods (from dictAvailableTime)\n\nSo you’ll have variables like x[\"IPA\", \"week_1\"], x[\"IPA\", \"week_2\"], etc.\n\n\n\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\nCode\n# Validate your solution\n# Check if variables exist in the model\n@assert haskey(lotsizeModel.obj_dict, :productBottled) \"productBottled variable not found in model\"\n@assert haskey(lotsizeModel.obj_dict, :productQuantity) \"productQuantity variable not found in model\"\n@assert haskey(lotsizeModel.obj_dict, :WarehouseStockPeriodEnd) \"WarehouseStockPeriodEnd variable not found in model\"\n\n# Check variable dimensions\n@assert length(productBottled) == length(dictBottlingTime) * length(dictAvailableTime) \"Incorrect dimensions for productBottled\"\n@assert length(productQuantity) == length(dictBottlingTime) * length(dictAvailableTime) \"Incorrect dimensions for productQuantity\"\n@assert length(WarehouseStockPeriodEnd) == length(dictBottlingTime) * length(dictAvailableTime) \"Incorrect dimensions for WarehouseStockPeriodEnd\"\n\n# Check variable types\n@assert all(is_binary, productBottled) \"productBottled must be binary variables\"\n@assert all(is_integer, productQuantity) == false \"productQuantity must be continuous variables\"\n@assert all(is_integer, WarehouseStockPeriodEnd) == false \"WarehouseStockPeriodEnd must be continuous variables\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, define the objective function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objective function needs to sum costs across all beer types and all periods. With dictionaries, you reference the data like this:\n@objective(model, Min,\n    sum(... for i in keys(dictBottlingTime), t in keys(dictAvailableTime))\n)\nInside the sum, you’ll need:\n\nSetup costs: setupHourCosts * dictSetupTime[i] * productBottled[i,t]\n\nThis uses dictSetupTime[i] to get the setup time for beer type i\n\nInventory holding costs: warehouseCosts * WarehouseStockPeriodEnd[i,t]\n\nNotice how we access dictionary values using dict[key] notation!\n\n\n\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\nCode\n# Validate your solution\n# Check if the model has an objective\n@assert objective_function(lotsizeModel) !== nothing \"Model must have an objective function\"\n\n# Check if it's a minimization problem\n@assert objective_sense(lotsizeModel) == MOI.MIN_SENSE \"Objective should be minimization\"\n\n# Check if the objective function contains both cost components\nobj_expr = objective_function(lotsizeModel)\n@assert contains(string(obj_expr), \"productBottled\") \"Objective must include setup costs (productBottled)\"\n@assert contains(string(obj_expr), \"WarehouseStockPeriodEnd\") \"Objective must include warehouse costs (WarehouseStockPeriodEnd)\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we need to define all necessary constraints for the model. Start with the demand/inventory balance constraint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first period is special, as it does not have a previous period. Furthermore, we are working with strings as variable references, thus we cannot use t-1 directly as in the lecture. To address this, we could collect and sort all keys and then use their indices to address the previous period. For example, all_periods[t-1] would then be the previous period, if we index t just as a range from 2:length(all_periods).\n\n\n\n\n# Get the first period and all periods\nfirst_period = first(sort(collect(keys(dictAvailableTime))))\nall_periods = sort(collect(keys(dictAvailableTime)))\n\nWith these, we can now define the demand/inventory balance constraint. As this is the first constraint and might be a bit tricky, the solution is already given below.\n\n# Inventory balance constraints for periods after first period\n@constraint(lotsizeModel,\n    demandBalance[i=keys(dictBottlingTime), t=2:length(all_periods)],\n    WarehouseStockPeriodEnd[i,all_periods[t-1]] + productQuantity[i,all_periods[t]] - WarehouseStockPeriodEnd[i,all_periods[t]] == dictDemand[i,all_periods[t]]\n    )\n\nNext, we need to ensure that we setup the production for a beer type only if we bottle the type at least once.\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\nLast, we need to define the constraint that limits the production quantity to the number of bottles that can be bottled within the available time.\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, implement the solve statement for your model instance.\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\nCode\n# Validate your solution\n@assert 539900 &lt;= objective_value(lotsizeModel) &lt;= 700000 \"Objective value should be between 539,000 and 700,000\"\n\n\nNow, unfortunately we cannot assert the value of the objective function perfectly here as we have to abort the computation due to the time limit and everybody is likely getting different results. The solution for the first task will likely be in the range of 600,000 to 700,000. If your model is solved within seconds, your formulation is not correct.\n\n\n\n\nThe following code creates production and warehouse plots for you. Use it to verify and visualize your solution in the following tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of the dataframes and the plots is implemented inside of a function, as we will need to use it multiple times in the following tasks.\n\n\n\n\n# Create the production results\nfunction create_production_results()\n    # Create a DataFrame to store the results\n    productionResults = DataFrame(\n        period = String[],\n        product = String[],\n        productBottled = Bool[],\n        productQuantity=Int[],\n        WarehouseStockPeriodEnd=Int[]\n    )\n\n    # Populate the DataFrame with the results\n    for i in keys(dictSetupTime)\n        for t in keys(dictAvailableTime)\n            push!(\n                productionResults,(\n                period = t,\n                product = i,\n                productBottled = value(productBottled[i,t])&gt;0.5 ? true : false,\n                productQuantity = ceil(Int,value(productQuantity[i,t])),\n                WarehouseStockPeriodEnd = ceil(Int,value(WarehouseStockPeriodEnd[i,t])),\n                )\n            )\n        end\n    end\n\n    sort!(productionResults,[:period, :product])\n    return productionResults\nend\n\n# Create the production plot\nfunction create_production_plot(productionResults)\n    p = groupedbar(\n        productionResults.period,\n        productionResults.productQuantity,\n        group=productionResults.product,\n        ylabel=\"Production Quantity (Bottles)\",\n        xlabel=\"Period\",\n        title=\"Production Schedule by Beer Type\",\n        size=(1200,600),\n        palette = :Set3,\n        legend=:outertopright,\n        xrotation = 45,\n        legendtitle=\"Beer Type\",\n        bar_width=0.7,\n        grid=false,\n        dpi=300\n    )\n    return p\nend\n\n# Create the warehouse stock plot\nfunction create_warehouse_plot(productionResults)\n    p = groupedbar(\n        productionResults.period,\n        productionResults.WarehouseStockPeriodEnd,\n        group=productionResults.product,\n        ylabel=\"Warehouse Stock\",\n        xlabel=\"Period\",\n        title=\"Warehouse Stock\",\n        size=(1200,600),\n        palette = :Set3,\n        legend=:outertopright,\n        xrotation = 45,\n        legendtitle=\"Beer Type\",\n        bar_width=0.7,\n        grid=false,\n        dpi=300\n    )\n    return p\nend\n\nThe following code creates the production plot.\n\nproductionResults = create_production_results()\np = create_production_plot(productionResults)\n\nThe following code creates the warehouse stock plot.\n\nproductionResults = create_production_results()\np = create_warehouse_plot(productionResults)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we calculate the setup and inventory costs for each period and store them in a DataFrame.

Your Prompts (and generated responses) pass through Langfuse to reach the selected LLM provider or guardrail service. The data is stored on our self-hosted server at Hetzner in Germany.\nHosting Provider (Hetzner): Our instance of Langfuse is self-hosted on servers provided by Hetzner Online GmbH. Hetzner acts as a data processor providing the infrastructure. We store application data and interaction logs on these servers, located within Germany.\nMistral AI: We use Mistral AI for two primary purposes: (1) as one of the LLM options to generate Responses to your Prompts, and (2) as a guardrail service to check Prompts and/or potential Responses (which may have been generated by Mistral AI itself) for safety, appropriateness, and compliance with content policies before a final response is delivered to you. When Mistral is used for either generation or guardrail checking, your data (relevant Prompts and/or potential Responses) is processed according to Mistral’s terms and privacy policy. The data ist not used or saved for training purposes by the model providers.\n\nImportant Note on Third-Party Processing: These LLM and guardrail providers process your data to generate Responses or perform safety checks. They may use data according to their own policies, potentially including service improvement, subject to their terms. We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies. We do not explicitly share personal identifiers like your name or email through the Chatbot interaction unless you voluntarily include such information in your Prompts."

    "text": "FAQs\n\nIs the course difficult?\nIn terms of difficulty, this is of course somehow complicated for me to assess. However, I have tried to make all the content as comprehensible as possible and really do ask you many questions in the lectures. If I have the impression that something has not been understood at all, then I take longer at that point. This semester is the first time I think the course is truly finished. I have adapted the slides based on feedback from the last two years and made all the examples as simple as possible. In a nutshell: If you are interested in the subject and equations do not scare you, you will likely do great in the course.\n\n\nHow can I download PDF slides from the lecture?\n\nFirst, open the lecture you want to download the slides from.\nThen, click on the RevealJS button in the top right corner.\nNow, click on the three stacked bars in the lower left corner.\nThen, click on Tools in the upper left corner.\nNow you can select PDF Export Mode and then save the slides as a PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this method does not work perfectly on all browsers. If you have a Chrome based browser, you should be fine.",

    "text": "Course Description\nIn this module, we explore the application of optimization techniques to solve real-world problems. Over the course of the semester, you’ll learn about various optimization challenges that have been tackled by the Institute of Logistics, Transport, and Production in collaboration with industry partners.\nThese practical problems include optimizing the sustainability of parcel delivery companies, ensuring corona-compliant crowd management at stadiums and theaters, and designing efficient district layouts for police authorities – to name just a few examples.\nThe module is structured around one lecture and one exercise per week. During exercises, you’ll work in groups with fellow students to program and solve small-scale problems. Bonus points are available for these exercises, which can contribute to your final exam grade at the end of the semester.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\nYou can find our specific outcomes in the module handbook. Our broader goal is to introduce you to how diversified the solution of practical problems can be. We want to enable you to independently apply methods and concepts from optimization, and to get a feeling for abstracting and modeling problems.\nIs our module hard? That’s a subjective question. We would say it is exciting and doable. If you have a basic interest in logical relationships and mathematics, you are in the right place. If you also have basic knowledge of programming or want to get into the subject with help, our module is perfect for you.\nUpon completion of the course, you …\n\ncan implement solutions to complex optimization problems in Julia\nknow advanced concepts of optimization such as linear and nonlinear optimization\nknow basic concepts of programming and algorithms such as loops, functions\nwill be able to read and write code in Julia\nwill have experience working with Julia libraries such as JuMP and HiGHS\nwill know how to collaborate in a small team to find solutions for problems at hand\n\nPlease note that this course is specifically designed for business students. That is, it is not required to have any advanced knowledge or experience in programming to attend this course. The teaching format will make it possible to account for different levels of programming skills such that every student can take the most out of the course.\n\n\nCourse Blocks\nThe core content of the course is organized in three blocks:\n\nPart I: Introduction to Julia and Modelling\nPart II: Applied Optimization with Basic Models\nPart III: Applied Optimization with Advanced Models\n\nYou can find more information on the course blocks and the corresponding lectures in the syllabus.\n\n\nTutorials\nThe tutorials accompany the lectures. In the tutorials, you will apply the concepts from the lectures to realistic data sets. You will work in small groups of 3 participants, in which you can work out solutions together. We will help you during the weekly practice sessions by answering your questions or briefly explaining individual issues in case of difficulties. Afterwards, you have the opportunity to submit your jointly developed solution until the next exercise date in order to earn bonus points for the exam. You can earn up to half a bonus point per exercise, up to 6.0 bonus points in total. Important: the bonus points will only be credited to you if you pass the exam with at least a 4.0. Furthermore, we will not award bonus points for exercises in which you have simply copied the results of another group.\n\n\nHow to see the slides\n\nThis course is based on Quarto\nIt uses revealjs to render the slides\nYou find the slides for each lecture in the corresponding lecture\nTo see the slides, click on RevealJS in the top right side in the lecture\n\n\n\nQuestions\nIf you have any questions regarding the course, please contact me under tobias.vlcek@uni-hamburg.de.\n\n\nContributors\nThanks to Matthes Koch and Justus Bonz, who helped to prepare the lecture materials.",

They determine how data is stored, manipulated, and how efficiently your code runs.\nThis script is designed to be interactive. Follow the instructions, write your code in the designated code blocks, and then execute the corresponding code. Each exercise is followed by an @assert statement that checks your solution.\n\n\n\nFirst, install the Julia and the Jupyter Extension from the extensions menu on the left side.\nOpen VS Code and navigate to the folder where you want to save all the files for this course.\nOpen the terminal in VS Code (Terminal → New Terminal) and run:\njulia --project=applied-optimization\nThis starts Julia with the course project environment.\nIn the Julia REPL that opens, run:\nusing Pkg\nPkg.instantiate()  # Initialize the project\nPkg.add(\"IJulia\")  # Add IJulia to the environment\nStill in Julia, run:\nusing IJulia\nIJulia.installkernel(\"Applied Optimization\", \"--project=applied-optimization\")\nThis creates a Jupyter kernel that uses the course environment.\nType exit() or press Ctrl+D to exit the Julia REPL.\nDownload the first .ipynb notebook from the course website and save it in your course folder.

But in following this, we have a clean environment we can work in and you basically cannot break anything with the installation of packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese steps ensure you’re working in the correct Julia environment with all course dependencies.

    "text": "Welcome to this beginner-friendly tutorial on mathematical optimization using JuMP and the HiGHS solver in Julia! Don’t worry if these terms sound unfamiliar – we’ll explain everything step by step.\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:\n\nSet up a simple optimization problem\nDefine variables and constraints\nCreate an objective function\nSolve the problem and interpret the results\n\nWe’ll use a real-world example to make these concepts more relatable. Imagine you’re managing a small factory that produces two types of products. Your goal is to maximize profit while working within certain limitations. This is exactly the kind of problem that mathematical optimization can solve!\n\n\nJuMP (Julia for Mathematical Programming) is a powerful tool that helps us describe optimization problems in a way that computers can understand and solve. Think of it as a translator between your business problem and the mathematical solver.\n\n\n\nHiGHS is an open-source solver that can find solutions to the optimization problems we describe using JuMP. It’s like a very smart calculator that can handle complex problems quickly and efficiently.\n\n\n\nLet’s break down our factory management problem:\n\nYou produce two products: Product A and Product B\nEach product gives you a different profit:\n\nProduct A: 100 profit per unit\nProduct B: 150 profit per unit\n\nYou have two departments: Cutting and Finishing\nEach product requires different amounts of time in each department:\n\nProduct A: 2 hours in Cutting, 4 hours in Finishing\nProduct B: 4 hours in Cutting, 3 hours in Finishing\n\nYou have limited time available in each department:\n\nCutting: 40 hours total\nFinishing: 60 hours total\n\n\nYour goal is to decide how many of each product to make to maximize your total profit, while not exceeding the available time in each department.\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to install and load the necessary packages. If you haven’t already installed JuMP and HiGHS, run the following code:\n\nimport Pkg\nPkg.activate(\"applied-optimization\")\nPkg.add([\"JuMP\",\"HiGHS\"])\n\nNow, let’s load these packages:\n\nusing JuMP, HiGHS\n\n\n┌ Error: Error during loading of extension SpecialFunctionsExt of ColorVectorSpace, use `Base.retry_load_extensions()` to retry.\n\n│   exception =\n\n│    1-element ExceptionStack:\n\n│    ArgumentError: Package SpecialFunctionsExt [997ecda8-951a-5f50-90ea-61382e97704b] is required but does not seem to be installed:\n\n│     - Run `Pkg.instantiate()` to install all recorded dependencies.\n\n│    \n\n│    Stacktrace:\n\n│      [1] __require_prelocked(pkg::Base.PkgId, env::Nothing)\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:2587\n\n│      [2] _require_prelocked(uuidkey::Base.PkgId, env::Nothing)\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:2465\n\n│      [3] _require_prelocked(uuidkey::Base.PkgId)\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:2459\n\n│      [4] run_extension_callbacks(extid::Base.ExtensionId)\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:1579\n\n│      [5] run_extension_callbacks(pkgid::Base.PkgId)\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:1616\n\n│      [6] run_package_callbacks(modkey::Base.PkgId)\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:1432\n\n│      [7] _require_search_from_serialized(pkg::Base.PkgId, sourcepath::String, build_id::UInt128, stalecheck::Bool; reasons::Dict{String, Int64}, DEPOT_PATH::Vector{String})\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:2106\n\n│      [8] _require_search_from_serialized\n\n│        @ ./loading.jl:1981 [inlined]\n\n│      [9] __require_prelocked(pkg::Base.PkgId, env::String)\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:2599\n\n│     [10] _require_prelocked(uuidkey::Base.PkgId, env::String)\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:2465\n\n│     [11] macro expansion\n\n│        @ ./loading.jl:2393 [inlined]\n\n│     [12] macro expansion\n\n│        @ ./lock.jl:376 [inlined]\n\n│     [13] __require(into::Module, mod::Symbol)\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:2358\n\n│     [14] require(into::Module, mod::Symbol)\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:2334\n\n│     [15] eval(m::Module, e::Any)\n\n│        @ Core ./boot.jl:489\n\n│     [16] include_string(mapexpr::typeof(REPL.softscope), mod::Module, code::String, filename::String)\n\n│        @ Base ./loading.jl:2843\n\n│     [17] softscope_include_string(m::Module, code::String, filename::String)\n\n│        @ SoftGlobalScope ~/.julia/packages/SoftGlobalScope/u4UzH/src/SoftGlobalScope.jl:65\n\n│     [18] execute_request(socket::ZMQ.Socket, msg::IJulia.Msg)\n\n│        @ IJulia ~/.julia/packages/IJulia/eenvU/src/execute_request.jl:81\n\n│     [19] eventloop(socket::ZMQ.Socket)\n\n│        @ IJulia ~/.julia/packages/IJulia/eenvU/src/eventloop.jl:14\n\n│     [20] (::IJulia.var\"#waitloop##2#waitloop##3\")()\n\n│        @ IJulia ~/.julia/packages/IJulia/eenvU/src/eventloop.jl:58\n\n└ @ Base loading.jl:1589\n\n\n\n\nGreat!

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are consulting for FitGear, a rapidly growing e-commerce company specializing in fitness equipment and athletic wear. FitGear is facing a challenge: customer complaints about split orders have increased by 40% in the last quarter. When a customer orders multiple items, they sometimes receive multiple packages from different warehouses, leading to higher shipping costs and frustrated customers.\nThis tutorial explores how to optimize SKU allocation across warehouses to minimize split orders using mathematical optimization.\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to understand which products are frequently purchased together. We’ll use a coappearance matrix. It shows how frequently items appear together in customer orders. For each pair of items (i,j), the matrix element Q[i,j] represents the number of orders containing both items i and j. Let’s start with a small sample of FitGear’s historical order data and determine the coappearance matrix of the transactional data set manually by hand.\n\n\n\n\\(t_{mi}\\)\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n2\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n3\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n4\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n5\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n6\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n7\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n8\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n\nWhat is the resulting coappearance matrix from the transactional data set? Please provide it in the following cell as matrix by changing the 0s to the correct values.\n\nQ = [\n    0 0 0 0;\n    0 0 0 0;\n    0 0 0 0;\n    0 0 0 0;\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nFitGear currently operates two warehouses - one in Hamburg and one in Berlin. Each warehouse has limited storage capacity:\n\nHamburg can store 3 different product types (SKUs)\nBerlin can also store 3 different product types\n\nBased on the coappearance matrix you have determined in the previous assignment, use the model from the lecture to maximise the coappearances manually by hand. What is the resulting objective function value of the assignment? Please provide it in the following cell.\n\nobjective_value_by_hand =\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the output of the optimisation, we don’t know the number of split orders yet. Calculate the number of split orders manually from your previous solution.\n\nnumber_of_split_parcels =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBonus Question\n\n\n\nIs the solution of the QMKP the optimal solution for the underlying split parcel minimisation problem? Try to come up with another solution that has less split or the same number of split parcels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs FitGear continues to grow, the operations team needs a solution that can handle their full product catalog. They now have:\n\n12 popular fitness products\n40 recent customer orders\nTwo warehouses with different capacities:\n\nHamburg: 7 SKUs\nBerlin: 6 SKUs\n\n\nThus, we’ll now implement a scalable solution using Julia and JuMP that can handle larger datasets.\n\nskus = [\n    \"Running Shoes\",\n    \"Athletic Socks\",\n    \"Water Bottle\",\n    \"Yoga Mat\",\n    \"Resistance Bands\",\n    \"Sports Bag\",\n    \"Protein Powder\",\n    \"Exercise Shorts\",\n    \"Training Shirt\",\n    \"Fitness Tracker\",\n    \"Foam Roller\",\n    \"Weight Gloves\"\n]\n\nwarehouses = [\"Hamburg\", \"Berlin\"]\n\ncapacity = [7, 6]\n\nT = [\n    # First set of transactions (1-20)\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;  # shoes + socks\n    1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0;  # shoes + socks + sports bag\n    0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0;  # yoga mat + bands + foam roller\n    0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;  # water bottle + yoga mat\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0;  # just protein powder\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1;  # protein powder + gloves\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0;  # shorts + shirt combo\n    0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0;  # workout outfit + bands\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0;  # just fitness tracker\n    1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0;  # full running gear set\n    0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1;  # home gym basics\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1;  # gym starter pack\n    0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;  # water bottle + bands\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0;  # running outfit complete\n    0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0;  # yoga equipment set\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1;  # protein powder + gloves\n    0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0;  # water bottle + protein\n    1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0;  # shoes + bag + tracker\n    0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0;  # workout outfit + bands\n    0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0;  # yoga mat + foam roller\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0;  # shoes + socks + workout clothes\n    1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0;  # shoes + socks + bag + tracker\n    0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1;  # yoga mat + bands + foam roller + gloves\n    0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;  # water bottle + yoga mat + bands\n    0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1;  # protein powder + water bottle + gloves\n    0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1;  # protein powder + bands + gloves\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0;  # shorts + shirt + tracker\n    1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0;  # shoes + workout outfit + bands\n    0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0;  # water bottle + tracker\n    1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0;  # deluxe running gear set\n    0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1;  # advanced home gym set\n    0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1;  # gym starter pack with water bottle\n    0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0;  # water bottle + bands + tracker\n    1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0;  # running outfit with bag\n    0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1;  # yoga equipment set with gloves\n    0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1;  # protein set with foam roller\n    0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0;  # water bottle + protein + bag\n    1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0;  # shoes + bag + tracker + foam roller\n    0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0;  # workout outfit + bands + tracker\n    0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0   # yoga mat + tracker + foam roller\n]\n\nImplement the model in Julia and solve it for the given data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteEach SKU can only be allocated to one warehouse!\n\n\n\nThe retailer has another requirement: each SKU can only be allocated to one warehouse. Make sure to include this requirement in your model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have Juniper, Ipopt and/or HiGHS installed, add the solver via Pkg.add(“Juniper”) and Pkg.add(“Ipopt”) and Pkg.add(“HiGHS”). Juniper is a solver for nonlinear problems, that can be used in combination with Ipopt and HiGHS to solve mixed-integer quadratic problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use the solver SCIP, you can also do this by adding JuMP and SCIP and then change the solver in the model definition to warehouse_model = Model(SCIP.Optimizer()). Note, that this does not work automatically in Windows, as you will have to install the SCIP binaries manually. Hence, I recommend to stick with Juniper. On Mac and Linux, SCIP should work out of the box.\n\n\n\nFirst, we start by defining the model.\n\n# Definition of the warehouse model\nusing JuMP, Ipopt, HiGHS, Juniper\nipopt = optimizer_with_attributes(Ipopt.Optimizer, \"print_level\" =&gt; 0)\nhighs = optimizer_with_attributes(HiGHS.Optimizer, \"output_flag\" =&gt; false)\nwarehouse_model = Model(\n    optimizer_with_attributes(\n        Juniper.Optimizer,\n        \"nl_solver\" =&gt; ipopt,\n        \"mip_solver\" =&gt; highs,\n    ),\n)\n\nA JuMP Model\n├ solver: Juniper\n├ objective_sense: FEASIBILITY_SENSE\n├ num_variables: 0\n├ num_constraints: 0\n└ Names registered in the model: none\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, compute the coappearance matrix based on the transactional data provided in T and call it Q.\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\nCode\n# Assert whether the coappearance matrix is correct.\n@assert Q == Q' \"The coappearance matrix is not symmetric.

The decision variable is correctly defined as a binary variable with proper dimensions.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, define the objective function to maximize the coappearance.\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\nCode\n# Assert whether the objective function is correct.\n@assert typeof(objective_function(warehouse_model)) &lt;: QuadExpr \"The objective function should be a quadratic expression of JuMP variables\"\nprintln(\"Great!

Have you correctly implemented the objective function?\"\nprintln(\"Great! The model is correctly solved.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following code prints the objective value, the SKU allocation and the warehouse capacities based on your optimal solution.\n\nprintln(\"Objective value: \", objective_value(warehouse_model))\nprintln()\nprintln(\"SKU Allocation:\")\nfor i in skus\n    for k in warehouses\n        if value(X[i,k]) &gt; 0.1\n            println(\"SKU: \", i, \" Allocation: \", k)\n        end\n    end\nend\nprintln()\nprintln(\"Warehouse Capacities:\")\nfor k in 1:length(warehouses)\n    println(\"Warehouse: \", warehouses[k], \" Capacity: \", capacity[k], \" Used: \", sum(value.(X[i,warehouses[k]]) for i in skus))\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the output of the optimisation, we still don’t know the number of split orders.

To do so, they offer different flavors of ice cream that are made and stored in a warehouse. Each flavor has a unique production time per unit of ice cream and no setup time for the production. In the first period, the company has 100 units of each flavor in storage at the end of the period.\nFurthermore, each setup of a different flavor costs a fixed amount of money identical for all flavors and periods, while the ice cream storage costs in the warehouse are different for each flavor but identical for all periods. These storage costs occur at the end of each period per unit of ice cream for all units not sold to cover the varying demand per flavor and period.\nEach period matches a shift length of a certain number of hours, identical for all periods. The objective is to minimize the total cost of production and storage while satisfying all demands and production capacities.\nDefine all sets, parameters and variables required to model the problem described above.

    "text": "Introduction\n\n\nSolutions\nYou will likely find solutions to most exercises online. However, I strongly encourage you to work on these exercises independently without searching explicitly for the exact answers to the exercises. Understanding someone else’s solution is very different from developing your own. Use the lecture notes and try to solve the exercises on your own. This approach will significantly enhance your learning and problem-solving skills.\nRemember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with different approaches, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification during class discussions.\n\nConsider the depicted ‘Golden Line’ on the left with 4 different stations A, B, C, D. For an upcoming timeframe of 10 minutes divided into 10 periods, the transportation demand is going to exceed the available capacity of the network and each origin-destination pair will be requested by at least 1 passenger. To handle the inflow, queues will be put in place at each metro station.\n\n\nThe Challenge\nYour task is to minimize the queues without exceeding the available transport capacity of max. 100 passengers per minute of each arc. A safety buffer per arc is not needed. Each station layout is excellent, with sufficient stairs and escalators. Thus, the station itself is fully capable of handling any inflow that may result from the optimized restricted inflow. Nonetheless, queues are still necessary as the arcs cannot handle each input.\n\n\n\n1. Flow Analysis\nSuppose we are in minute 7 at the arc of (D,A). Which inflows from which stations are going to impact the flow into the arc in this minute?\nWrite out the set \\(\\mathcal{R}_{(D,A),7}\\) and shortly explain your answer. You can write out the set in a comment, for example like this:\n#=\n{(A,B,1), (B,C,1), (C,D,1)}\n=#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo solve this task, it might be helpful to work with paper and pen to sketch the problem.\n\n\n\n\n#=\nYOUR ANSWER BELOW\n\n\n=#\n\n\n\n\n2. Inflow Control\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Fluctuations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Smoothed\n\n\n\n\nAs there is a rather large fluctuation of allowed inflow between periods, you are asked to introduce new constraints for the model. In the first period, the inflow at each station is supposed to be unrestricted. Thereafter, it is maximally allowed to change by 20 persons in both directions per period at each station.\nCan you write out the decision variables and the additional constraints for the model as JuMP constraints?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to solve the model or define the objective function. You just need to constraint the fluctuations and add the appropriate variables.\n\n\n\n\nusing JuMP\nmetro_model = Model()\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\n\n3.

Computing the Set \\(\\mathcal{R}_{e,t}\\)\nCan you compute the set \\(\\mathcal{R}_{e,t}\\) for the one-directional flow? Generate a dictionary \\(R\\) that contains \\(e \\times t\\) entries. Each entry \\(r_{e,t}\\) should contain a vector with all origin-destination pairs and the corresponding time period saved as a tuple. Use the results to check your answer from the first task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis task can be a bit tricky, as it is a bit of a challenge. But as it is the last tutorial, I figured a small challenge is fine.\n\n\n\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\nIf you encounter any difficulties ad cannot solve the problem, please document your issues here:\n\n#=\n\n\n\n=#\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\nYou will likely find solutions to most exercises online. However, I strongly encourage you to work on these exercises independently without searching explicitly for the exact answers to the exercises. Understanding someone else’s solution is very different from developing your own. Use the lecture notes and try to solve the exercises on your own. This approach will significantly enhance your learning and problem-solving skills.\nRemember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with different approaches, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification during class discussions.",
