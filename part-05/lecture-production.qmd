:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### Competitive environment

- Large competition among breweries
- Customer demand is changing
- Craft beer gains popularity
- Variety of beer types is increasing 
- Batch sizes of breweries are getting smaller

## Challenges {.columns}

![](images/crystal-kwok-h20daABLd08-unsplash.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### Different costs

- The bottling plant can fill multiple types of beers into bottles
- The bottling time depends on the beer type and batch size
- Changing beer type leads to set-up costs due to preparation and cleaning
- Unsold bottled beer can be stored in the warehouse, which leads to inventory costs

# Problem Structure

## Objective {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
### What could be the objective?

::: {.fragment}
Minimize the combined setup and inventory holding cost while satisfying the demand and adhering to the production capacity.
:::

### What is the trade-off?

::: {.fragment}
Larger batches require less setup cost per bottle, but increase the storage cost.

# Model Formulation

## Objective

### Objective

Minimize the combined setup and inventory holding cost while satisfying the demand and adhering to the production capacity.

### What could be our objective function?

$W_{i,t}$: Inventory of beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$ at the end of period $t\in\mathcal{T}$
$Y_{i,t}$: 1, if beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$ is bottled in period $t\in\mathcal{T}$, 0 otherwise

::: {.fragment}
$$
\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal{I}} \sum_{t=1}^{\mathcal{T}} (c_i \times W_{i,t} + f_i \times Y_{i,t})
$$
:::

## Constraints {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/clsp_oneperiod.pdf)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### What kind of constraints do we need?

::: {.fragment}
- Transfer the unused inventory of the last period
- Fulfill the customer demand in each period
- Calculate the batch size per set-up beer
- Compute the remaining inventory per period
- Set up beer types where the batch size is $\geq 0$
- Limit the capacity of the bottling plant
:::
:::

## Constraints

### Fulfill the customer demand in each period (while considering the current inventory and batch sizes) and compute the remaining inventory

$W_{i,t}$: Inventory of beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$ at the end of period $t\in\mathcal{T}$
$X_{i,t}$: Batch size of beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$ in $t\in\mathcal{T}$
$d_{i,t}$: Demand of beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$ in period $t\in\mathcal{T}$

::: {.fragment}
$$
W_{i,t-1} + X_{i,t} - W_{i,t} = d_{i,t} \quad \forall i\in\mathcal{I},t\in\mathcal{T}|t>1
$$
:::

## Constraints

### Set up beer types where the batch size is $\geq$ 0 to explicitly enforce the addition of setup costs in the objective function

$Y_{i,t}$: 1, if beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$ is bottled in period $t\in\mathcal{T}$, 0 otherwise
$X_{i,t}$: Batch size of beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$ in $t\in\mathcal{T}$
$d_{i,t}$: Demand of beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$ in period $t\in\mathcal{T}$

::: {.fragment}
$$
X_{i,t} \leq Y_{i,t} \times \sum_{\tau=1}^{\mathcal{T}} d_{i\tau} \quad \forall i\in\mathcal{I},\forall t\in\mathcal{T}
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
This type of constraint is also called a "Big-M" constraint!
:::

## Constraints

### Limit the capacity of the bottling plant

$Y_{i,t}$: 1, if beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$ is bottled in period $t\in\mathcal{T}$, 0 otherwise
$X_{i,t}$: Batch size of beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$ in $t\in\mathcal{T}$
$a_t$: Available time on the bottling plant in period $t\in\mathcal{T}$
$b_i$: Time used for bottling one unit of beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$
$g_i$: Setup time for beer type $i\in\mathcal{I}$

::: {.fragment}
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal{I}} (b_i \times X_{i,t} + g_i \times Y_{i,t}) \leq a_t \quad \forall t\in\mathcal{T}

## Capacitated Lot-Sizing Problem [@Haase1998]

\begin{align}
& \text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} (c_i \times W_{i,t} + f_i \times Y_{i,t})
\end{align}
$$

subject to

$$
\begin{align}
& W_{i,t-1} + X_{i,t} - W_{i,t} = d_{i,t} && \forall i\in\mathcal{I},t\in\mathcal{T}|t>1\\
& X_{i,t} \leq Y_{i,t} \times \sum_{\tau \in \mathcal{T}} d_{i,\tau} && \forall i\in\mathcal{I},\forall t\in\mathcal{T}\\
& \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} (b_i \times X_{i,t} + g_i \times Y_{i,t}) \leq a_t && \forall t\in\mathcal{T}\\
& Y_{i,t}\in\{0,1\} && \forall i\in\mathcal{I},t\in\mathcal{T} \\ 
& W_{i,t}, X_{i,t}\geq 0 && \forall i\in\mathcal{I},t\in\mathcal{T}
