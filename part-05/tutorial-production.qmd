# 3.a Modelling the CLSP

First, implement the CLSP from the lecture in Julia.

The weekly demand in bottles $d_{i,t}$, the available time at the bottling plant in hours $a_t$, the time required to bottle each beer in hours $b_i$, and the setup time in hours $g_i$ are provided as CSV files.

Consider in your implementation, that each hour of setup is associated with a cost of 1000 Euros, and the inventory holding cost for unsold bottles at the end of each period is 0.1 Euro per bottle.

Please provide us with a functional model in a .jl file that incorporates the aforementioned parameters and constraints. Note, that you can also provide the revised model from task b to answer this task.

# 3.b Initial Warehouse Stock

The model currently sets the initial warehouse stock levels without any restrictions.

Modify your model to incorporate an initial stock for all types of beer of zero at the beginning of the initial planning period.

Please provide a revised working model as .jl file.

## 3.c Scheduled repair

Unfortunately, the bottling plant has to undergo maintenance in periods "week_10" and "week_11".

Extend your model to prevent any production in those two periods. To hand-in this task, you can simply extend the previous model by these additional constraints.

## 3.d. Interpretation of the solution

1. Analyze the production schedule outlined in section 3.b. Is the workload distributed evenly across all time periods? Provide a rationale for your assessment and a plot of the aggregated production quantities over all beer sorts.

2. Based on the production data from the final period in 3.b, calculate the ending inventory levels for each type of beer. Discuss any significant findings.

3. Reflecting on a scenario where the company schedules its bottling operations biannually using the current method: identify and discuss potential pitfalls of this strategy. Offer at least one actionable suggestion for enhancing the efficiency or effectiveness of the production planning process. (Note: There's no need to code something in Julia for this part.)
