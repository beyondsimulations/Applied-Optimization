## FAQs

### Is the course difficult?

In terms of difficulty, this is of course somehow complicated for me to assess. However, I have tried to make all the content as comprehensible as possible and really do ask you many questions in the lectures. If I have the impression that something has not been understood at all, then I take longer at that point. This semester is the first time I think the course is truly finished. I have adapted the slides based on feedback from the last two years and made all the examples as simple as possible. 
**In a nutshell**: If you are interested in the subject and equations do not scare you, you will likely do great in the course.

### How can I download PDF slides from the lecture?

1. First, open the lecture you want to download the slides from. 
2. Then, click on the `RevealJS` button in the top right corner.
3. Now, click on the three stacked bars in the lower left corner.
4. Then, click on `Tools` in the upper left corner.
5. Now you can select `PDF Export Mode` and then save the slides as a PDF.
