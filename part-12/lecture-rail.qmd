# [Introduction]{.flow} {.title}

## FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}
![](images/metro_sign){width=85%}

::: {.column width="65%"}
::: {.block}
### Public transport during large events

- The entire FIFA Worldcup 2022 took place in a small region
- The capacity of the metro system was finite
- More than 1 million tourists where expected at the Worldcup
- Metro usage was free for all ticket holders
- All transport methods were expected to be heavily overloaded

## FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar {#pic-arabshahi .columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/amir-arabshahi-ERSKz8OrZIQ-unsplash){width=75%}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
::: {.block}
### Risk of crowd disasters

- Within transfer stations
- At the entries of metro stations
- At event venues
:::
:::

## Metrosystem of Doha

![](images/overview){width=80%}

## {.standout}

The metro system is vulnerable, as the Red Line has twice the capacity of the Green Line and the Gold Line...

## Further issues {#pic-tudor .columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.block}
### Large scale events

- Authorities often don't exactly know how many people will participate in the event
- Thus, they have to rely on forecasts and uncertain data to prepare
- It is crucial, to make this forecasts as good as possible in order to prevent accidents
:::
:::

## Problem Structure {.section}

## Objective {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
::: {.block}
### What could be the objectives of the authorities?

::: {.fragment}
- A safe and successful event as host country
- Good publicity and a positive recognition worldwide  
- Satisfied visitors that enjoyed their time
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.block}
### What could we try to model?

::: {.fragment}
None of the above directly. [But]{.alert} we can assist in the estimation of transport demands and the design of operational plans to ensure public safety and a smooth transportation through the city.
:::
:::
:::
:::

## {.standout}

What could be an issue for the design of operational plans for the public transportation system?

## How to estimate the data? {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/where_data){width=85%}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.block}
### Simulation

- Based on publicly available data
- Includes all individuals participating at the event and all transportation infrastructure
- Individual mode choice based on a choice model (Choice Based Optimization)  
- Modes: Car, Bus, MetroLink, Walk, Taxi

## How to estimate the data? {#pic-weirick .columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/jake-weirick-MSKqOpeNSt4-unsplash){width=85%}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.block}
### Results of the Simulation

- Detailed movement of individuals throughout the region
- Potential sections at risk in the transport infrastructure
- Potential capacity overloads at event locations  
- [Includes a lot of assumptions!]{.alert}
