Welcome to Applied Optimization with Julia!

In this module, we explore the application of optimization techniques to solve real-world problems. Over the course of the semester, you'll learn about various optimization challenges that have been tackled by the Institute of Logistics, Transport, and Production in collaboration with industry partners.

These practical problems include optimizing the sustainability of parcel delivery companies, ensuring corona-compliant crowd management at stadiums and theaters, and designing efficient district layouts for police authorities – to name just a few examples.

Course Structure

The module is structured around one lecture and one exercise per week. During exercises, you'll work in groups with fellow students to program and solve small-scale problems. Bonus points are available for these exercises, which can contribute to your final exam grade at the end of the semester.

Content is organized into three progressive blocks:
Introduction to Julia and Modelling
Applied Optimization with Basic Models
Applied Optimization with Advanced Models

What You'll Learn

Our goal is to demonstrate the versatility of optimization solutions and equip you with the skills to independently apply optimization methods and concepts. We'll also help you develop an understanding of how to abstract and model problems effectively.

By the end of this course, you will:
Implement solutions to complex optimization problems in Julia
Master advanced optimization concepts (linear and nonlinear optimization)
Understand programming fundamentals (loops, functions, algorithms)
Read and write Julia code confidently
Work with powerful Julia libraries like JuMP and HiGHS
Collaborate effectively in small teams to solve real problems

Why Julia Instead of Python?

You might wonder why we chose Julia for this course rather than Python. Here are the key reasons:
Julia is designed for high-performance numerical computing, combining the ease of use of high-level languages with the speed of compiled languages.
Julia's JuMP is one of the fastest optimization frameworks available, often outperforming Python alternatives by significant margins. This means your optimization models run faster, allowing you to iterate and experiment.
Julia's growing adoption in scientific computing and operations research makes it a strategic addition to your skill set alongside Python.
As LLMs become more prevalent in software development, being comfortable with different programming paradigms and languages will help you leverage these tools more effectively. Julia's approach offers a fresh perspective that complements Python knowledge.

Is This Course Right for You?

Is our module challenging? That's a matter of perspective. We'd say it's engaging and achievable, as long as you have a basic interest in logical relationships and mathematics. We don't require any advanced programming knowledge – our teaching format accommodates different skill levels, ensuring every student can follow.

That said, if you just want to visit a course, where it is easy to receive a good mark without active participation in the tutorials and lectures, this might not be the course for you.
