## Challenges

[Question:]{.question} **What makes the work of emergency services complex?**

::: {.incremental}
- Dynamic urban development
- Changing population patterns
- Resource constraints
- Need for rapid response
- Multiple stakeholder interests
:::

## Emergency Services

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

:::
::: {.column width="55%"}
Emergency services address the needs of [three interest groups]{.highlight}: 

- Citizens
- Service personnel
- Administrators

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the objectives of these groups?**

:::
:::

## Stakeholder Objectives

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
1. **Citizens**
   - Fast response times
   - Reliable service coverage

2. **Service Personnel**
   - Manageable workloads
   - Safe working conditions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
3. **Administrators**
   - Cost efficiency
   - Resource optimization


::: {.callout-note .fragment}
Aligning the objectives of the three interest groups is challenging.

## Emergency Service Districting

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1689783101576-627f2fbdb8d5?q=80&w=3687&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D){width=85%}
:::
::: {.column width="55%"}
[Question:]{.question} **Why might current district layouts be suboptimal?**

::: {.incremental}
- Many layouts [date back several decades]{.highlight}
- Often designed along highways and regions [@Bruce2009]
- Extensive data **not used** for data-driven improvement
:::
:::
:::

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
How can we improve

this situation?
:::

::: footer
:::

## The Role of Data

::: {.block}
[Question:]{.question} **What data can help improve emergency services?**

::: {.incremental}
- Historical incident patterns
- Response time analysis
- Resource utilization metrics
- Population densities and traffic patterns
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
Extensive data collected, but often [lack of tools or knowledge]{.highlight} to leverage it.
:::

## Optimization

- [Operations research (OR)]{.highlight} models can help!
- Based on **incident records** and **geographical information**
- Improve the **response of emergency services**
- Help administrators in making **strategic decisions**
- Locate [new departments]{.highlight} or [close departments]{.highlight} [@Liberatore2020]

# [Case Studies]{.flow} {.title}

## Police Districting

> For an efficient and effective distribution of resources, police jurisdictions are divided into precincts or command districts with separate departments. These are further divided into patrol beats [@DAmico2002].

## Service Priority Extremes

- **High Priority**
   - Life-threatening situations
   - Active crimes in progress
   - Multiple unit response needed

- **Low Priority**
   - Minor incidents
   - Administrative tasks

## Case Studies

- [Different urban contexts]{.highlight}
- Study of jurisdictions in
  - Germany: Large metropolitan area
  - Belgium: Large rural area
- Focus on [response time optimization]{.highlight}

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
Part of the force patrols the streets, another part is **stationed at the departments**.
:::


## Dispatching 

- Dispatchers assign all CFS to vehicles from the [corresponding districts and patrol areas]{.highlight}
- Officers are **familiar with the area** and are thus better prepared to respond appropriately [@Bodily1978]
- To cope with high demands, dispatchers can **assign vehicles from nearby districts or beats**

## Potential Problem 

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the potential problem?**

. . .

- This can lead to a [domino effect]{.highlight}
- Transferring vehicles from other districts or beats **reduces coverage in those locations** [@Mayer2009]
- This makes them vulnerable to missing resources when **they need assistance themselves**

## Overloaded Systems

- This can lead to [overloaded systems!]{.highlight}
- Long dispatching delays due to **staff shortages**
- Preventive patrol hardly possible [@Miller1972]
- Dispatchers **constantly** draw on patrol resources
- Reduces the **response time** of emergency services

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
This is a **common problem** in many emergency services.
:::

## Response Time

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="35%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-responsetime.svg){width=55%}
:::
::: {.column width="65%"}
- Central criterion to measure the [effectiveness of emergency services]{.highlight} is the response time
- Time between a **call for aid** and the arrival at the **incident location**
- Low response time increases the likelihood of helping and improves confidence [@Bodily1978]
:::
:::

## Response Time Influencers

[Question:]{.question} **What affects response time?**

::: {.incremental}
- Initial contact
- Information gathering
- Unit assignment
- Resource coordination
- Route to location
- Traffic conditions
:::

# [Territory Design Problem]{.flow} {.title}

## Territory Design Problem

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-hex_1.svg){width=90%}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}


> Aggregation of **small geographic areas**, called basic areas (BAs), into geographic clusters, called districts, so that these are acceptable according to **pre-defined planning criteria**[^zoltners].
:::
:::

[^zoltners]: @Zoltners1983

## Objective

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the objective?**

. . .

- [Minimize the response time]{.highlight} to help citizens faster while **increasing the confidence in the service**

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be further objectives?**

. . .

- Reallocate **only part** of the police department's
- Compact and contiguous territories to **improve patrol**
- Prevention of **isolated departments**

## Basic Structure

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="25%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-hex_to_centroid.svg){width=85%}
:::
::: {.column width="75%"}
[Question:]{.question} **How can we structure this?**

::: {.incremental}
- Model as a **digraph** with vertices and edges
- Each BA centroid becomes a **vertex**
- $\mathcal{J}$ : set of BAs, indexed by $j$
- $\mathcal{I}$ : set of potential district centres $(\mathcal{I} \subseteq \mathcal{J})$
:::
:::
:::

## Why Hexagons? 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="25%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-vertex_connected.svg){width=70%}
:::
::: {.column width="75%"}
[Question:]{.question} **Advantages of hexagons?**

::: {.incremental}
- [Equal distances]{.highlight} to all neighboring centroids
- Reduces sampling bias from edge effects [@Wang2018a]
- Special properties that help with the enforcement of **compactness**
- Better representation of urban geography
:::
:::
:::

## Response Time Components

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="25%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-responsetime.svg){width=80%}
:::
::: {.column width="75%"}
[Question:]{.question} **How can we model response time?**

::: {.incremental}
- Call length is [independent]{.highlight} of territory
- Dispatch time is **difficult to model**
- Driving time can be **minimized directly**
:::

::: {.callout-warning .fragment}
## Conclusion
We focus on **minimizing expected driving times** between departments and incident locations.
:::
:::
:::

# [Model Formulation]{.flow} {.title}

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
Let's build our model

step by step!
:::

::: footer
:::

## Key Model Components

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our key model components?**

. . .

- Basic areas (BAs) and potential department locations
- Driving times between basic areas
- Forecasted incident data
- Assignment decisions

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Which are sets, parameters, and variables?**

## Sets and Indices

::: {.incremental}
- $\mathcal{J}$ - Set of BAs, indexed by $j$
- $\mathcal{I}$ - Set of potential district centres ($\mathcal{I} \subseteq \mathcal{J}$), indexed by $i$
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
The depot locations are a [subset]{.highlight} of the basic areas!
:::

## Parameters

[Question:]{.question} **What parameters do we need?**

::: {.incremental}

- $p$ - Number of district centres (departments)
- $t_{i,j}$ - Expected driving times between $i$ and $j$

:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
Parameters should be carefully calibrated with real-world data!
:::

## Decision Variable(s)?

::: {.callout-note}
## We have the following sets:

- BAs, indexed by $j \in \mathcal{J}$
- Potential department locations, indexed by $i \in \mathcal{I}$
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## Our objective is to:
[Minimize the expected response time]{.highlight} of the emergency services by optimizing the assignment of BAs to departments.
:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What decisions do we need to model?**

## Decision variable/s

- $X_{i,j}$: 1 if BA $j$ assigned to department $i$, 0 otherwise

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What is the domain of our decision variable?**

. . .

- $X_{i,j} \in \{0,1\} \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{I}, \forall j \in \mathcal{J}$

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
Let's build our

objective function!
:::

::: footer
:::

## Objective Function?

::: {.callout-important}
## Our objective is to:

[Minimize the expected response time]{.highlight} of the emergency services by optimizing the assignment of BAs to departments.
:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **How do we minimize response time?**

::: {.incremental}
- We want to minimize **total driving time**
- Consider frequency of incidents in each BA
- Don't include fixed costs (handled by constraints)

:::

## Objective Function

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our objective function?**

. . .

$$
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}}\sum_{j \in \mathcal{J}} t_{i,j} \times X_{i,j}
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## Expected Driving Time

- Total driving time **across all assignments**
- Weighted by **incident frequency**
- Considers **all possible BA-department pairs**

:::


# [Constraints]{.flow} {.title}

## Key Constraints

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-hex_2.svg){width=90%}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

[Question:]{.question} **Constraints needed?**

::: {.incremental}
1. BA must have [one]{.highlight} department
2. Limit **number of departments**
3. Only assign **active** departments
4. Ensure **contiguous** districts 
5. Maintain district **compactness**
:::

:::

:::

## Single Assignment Constraint?

[Question:]{.question} **Why do we need this constraint?**

. . .

- Each BA must be assigned to [exactly one]{.highlight} department
- Prevents **overlapping** jurisdictions
- Ensures **complete coverage**

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following variables:

- $X_{i,j}$ - 1 if BA $j$ assigned to department $i$, 0 otherwise

:::

## Single Assignment Constraint?

[Question:]{.question} **What could the constraint look like?**

. . .


$$
\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} X_{i,j} = 1 \quad \forall j \in \mathcal{J}
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
Each BA must be assigned to exactly one department.
:::

## Department Count Constraint?

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of these constraints is to:
Ensure that exactly $p$ departments are opened.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following sets and variables:

- $\mathcal{I}$ - Set of potential department locations, indexed by $i$
- $\mathcal{J}$ - Set of BAs, indexed by $j$
- $X_{i,j}$ - 1, if BA $j$ assigned to department $i$, 0 otherwise
- $p$ - Number of departments
 
:::

## Department Count Constraint

[Question:]{.question} **What could the constraint look like?**

. . .

$$
\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} X_{i,i} = p
$$

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What happens if we have more departments than potential locations?**

. . .

- We **can't open more departments** than there are locations
- The model **will be infeasible**

## Active Department Constraint?

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of these constraints is to:
Ensure that each BA is assigned to an active department, e.g. a department that is opened and that could dispatch vehicles.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following sets and variables:
- $X_{i,j}$ - 1, if BA $j$ assigned to department $i$, 0 otherwise
:::

[Question:]{.question} **How do we ensure assignments only to active departments?**

## Active Department Constraint

$$
X_{i,j} \leq X_{i,i} \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{I}, \forall j \in \mathcal{J}
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
This constraint creates a **logical connection between department locations and BA assignments** where BAs can only be assigned to [opened]{.highlight} departments.
:::


## p-Median Problem

\begin{align}
\text{minimize} \quad & \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}}\sum_{j \in \mathcal{J}} t_{i,j} \times X_{i,j} \\
\text{subject to:} \quad & \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} X_{i,j}= 1 && \forall j \in \mathcal{J} \\
& \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} X_{i,i} = p &&  \\
& X_{i,j} \leq X_{i,i} &&  \forall i \in \mathcal{I}, \forall j \in \mathcal{J}  \\
& X_{i,j} \in \{0,1\}  && \forall i \in \mathcal{I}, \forall j \in \mathcal{J} 
\end{align}

# [Contiguity and Compactness]{.flow} {.title}

## Contiguity Introduction

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-hex_1.svg){width=85%}
:::
::: {.column width="55%"}
[Question:]{.question} **Why is contiguity important?**

::: {.incremental}
- Prevents **isolated areas**
- Ensures **contiguous patrol routes**
- Maintains **operational coherence**
:::
:::
:::

## What is compactness?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-hex_1.svg){width=100%}
:::
::: {.column width="34%"}

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-hex_3.svg){width=100%}
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## Compactness
Compactness has **no univocal definition**; a district is commonly declared compact if it is 'somehow round-shaped and undistorted' [@Kalcsics2005].
:::

## Contiguity and Compactness

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-hex_2.svg){width=100%}
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

[Question:]{.question} **Are our resulting districts based on the model contiguous and compact?**

::: {.incremental}
- This depends on $t_{i,j}$
- **If Euclidean distance**
   - Districts will be contiguous
   - Likely of compact shape
:::
:::
:::


## [Compactness p-Median]{.invert-font} {background-color="#000000" background-image="https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-streets.svg"}

[**Question:** Is this likely for police service districting?]{.invert-font .fragment}

::: {.invert-font .fragment}
- No, as we minimize the driving time within a city
- Highways, Tunnels, etc.
- Multiplied by the differing number of requested cars
- This can contribute to distorted district shapes
:::

:::{.footer}
:::

## Contiguity Sets

[Additional Set and Parameter]{.highlight}

- $e_{i,j}$ - Euclidean distance between centroids
- $\mathcal{A}_j$ - Sets of BAs adjacent to BA $j$

. . .

$$
\mathcal{N}_{i,j}=\{v \in \mathcal{A}_j | e_{i,v} < e_{i,j}\} \quad \forall i\in \mathcal{I}, \forall j\in \mathcal{J}
$$

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
## The idea
BAs **closer to department** $i$ than BA $j$ on euclidian distance and **adjacent to** $j$!

:::

## Example A {auto-animate="true"}

## Example B {auto-animate="true"}

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-contigous-4.svg)

## Enforcing Contiguity

**All districts have to be contiguous**

$$
X_{i,j} \leq \sum_{v \in \mathcal{N}_{i,j}} X_{i,v} \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{I}, \forall j \in \mathcal{J} \setminus \mathcal{A}_i: i \neq j
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## The idea

At least **one department** has to be assigned to a BA that is adjacent to BA $j$ and closer to department $i$!

:::

## Contiguity and Compactness

**All districts have to be contiguous and compact**

\begin{align*}
X_{i,j} &\leq \sum_{v \in \mathcal{N}_{i,j}}X_{i,v} && \forall i \in \mathcal{I}, \forall j \in \mathcal{J} \setminus \mathcal{A}_i:|\mathcal{N}_{i,j}|= 1 \wedge i \neq j \\
2X_{i,j} &\leq \sum_{v \in \mathcal{N}_{i,j}}X_{i,v} && \forall i \in \mathcal{I}, \forall j \in \mathcal{J} \setminus \mathcal{A}_i:|\mathcal{N}_{i,j}|> 1 \wedge i \neq j 
\end{align*}

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## The idea

At least **two departments** have to be assigned to a BA that is adjacent to BA $j$ and closer to department $i$!

:::

## Comparison

::: {.column width="33%"}
![One department](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-hex_1.svg){width=100%}

![Up to three departments](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_police-hex_3.svg){width=100%}
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## Why does this work?
Due to the constraints, there is **always a path back** to the department if a BA is assigned to a department!
