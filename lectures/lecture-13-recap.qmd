Any questions

regarding the

past lectures?

## What have we learned?

- How to **identify and abstract** real-world problems
- How to **start programming** in Julia
- How to **model and solve** optimization problems
- How to **question** model assumptions

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
That's a lot and a great foundation for a seminar or a master thesis!

# [How to continue?]{.flow} {.title}

## How to continue after the lecture?

- The best way is to [keep programming and modeling]{.highlight}
- We are offering **seminars and master thesis**
- Try to find a way to **apply programming in your work**
- There are **many interesting topics** to explore!

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
Getting your supervisors on board is the hardest part! But note, that it is often worth it and the tools we have used are all free and open-source.
:::

## Concrete Next Steps

- Join online communities on Julia and Optimization
- Contribute to open-source projects if you can
- Follow key researchers and practitioners
- Start a small personal project using the tools learned

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
If you want to start a small personal project, try to find a problem that you are interested in and that you can solve using the tools we have learned.
:::

## Start Pair Programming with AI

- First, try to [be confident with the basics]{.highlight} of a language
- Always try to [understand the code you use]{.highlight}
- If you want to try **AI pair programming**, use Cursor as IDE

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
Cursor is a great IDE for AI pair programming, although it is not completely free. It has Claude and ChatGPT integrated and makes work much easier when compared to copying and pasting code.

# [Final Words]{.flow} {.title}

## That's it for the Lecture Series!

- I hope you **enjoyed** the lecture and found it **helpful**
- On Friday, we will have a [discussion session]{.highlight}
- You can earn the **last half-bonus point** for the exam
- I wish you **all the best for your studies and your career!**

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
If you have any questions on optimization in the future, feel free to contact me!
