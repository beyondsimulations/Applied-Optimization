# # Tutorial II.I - Variables and Types
#
# Applied Optimization with Julia
#
# # Introduction
#
# Welcome to this interactive Julia tutorial which introduces the basics
# of variables and types. Understanding variables and their types is
# crucial as they are the building blocks of any program. They determine
# how data is stored, manipulated, and how efficiently your code runs.
#
# This script is designed to be interactive. Follow the instructions,
# write your code in the designated code blocks, and then execute the
# corresponding code. Each exercise is followed by an `@assert` statement
# that checks your solution.
#
# There are two ways to run the code:
#
# 1.  The easiest way to run the code is by using VS Code. First, install
#     the Julia and the Jupyter Extension. Then, you can open the
#     downloaded `.ipynb` files and run the code from there.
#
# 2.  The second way is by using IJulia. Start Julia, and type
#     `using IJulia; notebook()` in the Julia prompt. This will open a new
#     browser window where you can run the code. If you have not installed
#     IJulia yet, you can do so by typing `]` in the Julia prompt to open
#     the package manager, and then installing IJulia by typing
#     `add IJulia`.

# # Section 1 - Variables
#
# Think of variables as labeled containers. Just like you might label a
# box “Books” to store books, in programming we label our data with
# variable names. For example:

# %%
age = 30        # A box labeled "age" containing the number 30

# %%
name = "Tobias"  # A box labeled "name" containing the text "Tobias"

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 1.1 - Declare a Variable
#
# Declare a variable named `x` and assign it the value `1`.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW


# %%
# Test your answer
@assert x == 1 "Check again, the value of x should be 1. Remember to assign the value directly to x."
println("Great, you have correctly assigned the value $x to the variable 'x'.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 1.2 - Declare a String Variable
#
# Declare a variable named `hi` and assign it the string
# `"Hello, Optimization!"`.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Test your answer
@assert hi == "Hello, Optimization!" "Make sure the variable 'hi' contains the exact string \"Hello, Optimization\"!"
println("Good, the variable 'hi' now states \"$hi\".")

# %% [markdown]
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# # Section 2 - Basic Types
#
# Just like real containers come in different types (like boxes for books,
# refrigerators for food, etc.), variables in Julia have different types
# depending on what they store:
#
# -   Integers (Int): Whole numbers like `1`, `42`, `-10`
# -   Floats (Float64): Numbers with decimal points like `3.14`, `-0.5`
# -   Booleans (Bool): True/false values like `true`, `false`
# -   Strings (String): Text in quotes like `"Hello"`
#
# You can check what type of “container” a variable is using `typeof()`.
# Try this:

# %%
age = 25
typeof(age)     # Will show Int64 (integer type)

# %%
price = 19.99
typeof(price)   # Will show Float64 (decimal number type)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 2.1 - Create an Integer Variable
#
# Create an Integer variable `answerUniverse` and set it to `42`.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW


# %%
# Test your answer
@assert answerUniverse == 42 "The variable 'answerUniverse' should hold 42."
println("Great, the answer to all questions on the universe is $answerUniverse now.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 2.2 - Create a Float Variable
#
# Create a Float variable `money` and set it to `1.35`.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW


# %%
# Test your answer
@assert money == 1.35 "The variable 'money' should hold the Float64 1.35."
println("Perfect, the you have stored $money in the variable 'money'.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 2.3 - Create a Boolean Variable
#
# Create a Boolean variable `isStudent` and set it to `true`.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW


# %%
# Test your answer
@assert isStudent == true "The variable 'isStudent' should be set to true."
println("Correct, you are a student now.")

# %% [markdown]
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# # Section 3 - Type Annotations and Inference
#
# Sometimes we want to specify exactly what kind of “container” we want to
# use. In Julia, we can do this using type annotations:

# %%
temperature::Float64 = 98.6    # Specifically saying we want a decimal number

# %%
count::Int64 = 100            # Specifically saying we want a whole number

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 3.1 - Type Annotation
#
# Declare a variable `y` with an explicit type annotation of `Int64` and
# assign it the value `5`.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW


# %%
# Test your answer
@assert y == 5 && typeof(y) == Int64 "Make sure 'y' is of type Int64 and has the value 5."
println("Great! You've created an Int64 variable 'y' with the value $y.")

# %% [markdown]
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# # Section 4 - String Interpolation
#
# String interpolation is like filling in blanks in a sentence. Instead of
# writing:

# %%
name = "Tobias"
age = 30
# The hard way:
message = "My name is " * name * " and I am " * string(age) * " years old"

# %% [markdown]
# We can use the `$` symbol to insert variables directly into our text:

# %%
message = "My name is $name and I am $age years old"

# %% [markdown]
# It’s like having a template where Julia automatically fills in the
# values for you! If you have paid attention to the previous excercise,
# you have already seen this in action. The following example illustrates
# this again:

# %%
language = "Julia"
println("I'm learning $language")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 4.1 - String Interpolation
#
# Create a string `message` that says `"y is [value of y]"` using string
# interpolation.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW


# %%
# Test your answer
@assert message == "y is 5" "Make sure your string includes the correct value of y."
println("Excellent! Your interpolated string is: $message")

# %% [markdown]

#
# # Conclusion
#
# Congratulations! You have completed the first tutorial on Variables and
# Types. You’ve learned about the basics of variables, integers, floats,
# booleans, and strings. Continue to the next file to learn more.
#
# # Solutions
#
# You will likely find solutions to most exercises online. However, I
# strongly encourage you to work on these exercises independently without
# searching explicitly for the exact answers to the exercises.
# Understanding someone else’s solution is very different from developing
# your own. Use the lecture notes and try to solve the exercises on your
# own. This approach will significantly enhance your learning and
# problem-solving skills.
#
# Remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to
# understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you
# encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with
# different approaches, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification during
# class discussions.
#
# Later, you will find the solutions to these exercises online in the
# associated GitHub repository, but we will also quickly go over them in
# next week’s tutorial. To access the solutions, click on the Github
# button on the lower right and search for the folder with today’s lecture
# and tutorial. Alternatively, you can ask ChatGPT or Claude to explain
# them to you. But please remember, the goal is not just to complete the
# exercises, but to understand the concepts and improve your programming
# abilities.
