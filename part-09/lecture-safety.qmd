[Question:]{.question} **Have you ever heard of the Hajj?**
:::

::: {.footer}
:::

## The Hajj
- **The great Islamic pilgrimage towards Mecca**
- The holy city is the **religious center** of the Islamic religion
- Located in the **Kingdom of Saudi Arabia**
- Each physically able Muslim should **perform Hajj once**
- [Confined spaces]{.highlight} around the holy sites
- Only **few million** people are annually allowed

## Mina Tent City {auto-animate="true"}

## Mina Tent City {auto-animate="true"}

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-mecca03.png){fig-align="center"}

## The scope of the Hajj

- Pilgrimage is actually a [multi-day journey]{.highlight}
- Involves a number of **different rituals at several ritual sites**
- Our efforts focused on the **Rhamy-Al-Jamarat ritual**

. . .

::: {.callout-caution}
## Rhamy-Al-Jamarat ritual
Pilgrims throw pebbles against three pillars, which symbolize the temptations of the devil. They repeat this ritual with small variations on four consecutive days.
:::

## [Mina Tent City]{.invert-font} {background-image="https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-tents.jpg" background-size="cover" background-position="center"}

::: {.fragment .invert-font}
- 1.5–2 million people reside in the tent city
- Pilgrims repeatedly access the holy site
- Perform the Rhamy-Al-Jamarat ritual
- Walk through a network of streets and pathways
- Later proceed to the Kaaba or return to the camp
:::

::: {.footer}
:::

## Time Preferences

- [When to perform the ritual on each of the four days?]{.highlight}
- Pilgrims have different **time preferences**
  - Constrained by **arrival and departure** shuttle times
  - Extremely **hot at midday** quickly leading to exhaustion
  - Traditions play an **important role** in time preferences

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could become a problem?**

## Risk: Overcrowding at Mina

- In aggregation, the time preferences are **clustered**
- **Popular peak times** dating back to the Prophet Mohammad
- Equates to a [city-scale crowd of millions of people]{.highlight}
- Accessing **one central place** within only a few hours


. . .

::: {.callout-caution}
**Uncoordinated** access within confined area can **escalate into crowd disasters**!
:::

## Crowd Accidents

- **Historical incidents** of crowd disasters
- Resulted in **casualties and injuries**
- **High-density bottlenecks** on the way to the rituals
- Several [critical points of congestion]{.highlight}
- Waiting times can lead to **hazardous conditions**

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could we do to prevent this?**

# [Pedestrian Traffic]{.flow} {.title}

![3.](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-multidirectional_crossing_flow.png){width=30%}

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What is the most dangerous type here?**

. . .

::: {.callout-caution}
**Multi-directional and intersecting flows** are the most dangerous type!
:::

## Pilgrim Flows

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-jamarat_flow.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.callout-note}
## General idea
Adhere to **one-way flow systems** and define path options for each camp under consideration of a unidirectional flow system.
:::

# [Problem Structure]{.flow} {.title}

## Objective?

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the objective?**

::: {.incremental}
- Minimize [risk of overcrowding and accidents]{.highlight}
- **Enable ritual participation** of all pilgrims
- **Satisfy time preferences** of pilgrims
- **Easy plans to execute** under pressure
:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **How can we try to model this?**

## Objective

- Satisfy [time preferences as much as possible]{.highlight}
- Consideration of **infrastructure bottleneck flow capacities**
- **Maximize safety** for all pilgrims
- **Simple plans** to make the execution as simple as possible
- This can **prevent critical errors** later on!

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Where is the goal conflict?**

## Goal Conflict

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-goalconflict.png){fig-align="center"}

## Basic Structure

- We follow the structure of a **simple scheduling problem**
- The aim is to "assign" something to **different time periods**
- We assign [time slots to groups using different paths]{.highlight}
- Plans are kept simpler by assigning **paths to camps**
- Assignments are **fixed over the entire time horizon**

## Pilgrim Routes {auto-animate="true" .smaller}

Each camp has a set of feasible one-way paths that include the stoning ritual.

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-m_a.svg)

## Pilgrim Routes {auto-animate="true" .smaller}

Path may contain one or more bottlenecks, regarded as resources subject to a capacity.

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-m_b.svg)

## Pilgrim Routes {auto-animate="true" .smaller}

Pilgrims departure from a camp at a time $x$ and pass through the bottleneck later.

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-m_c.svg)

## Pilgrim Routes {auto-animate="true" .smaller}

Our model should assign one of the feasible paths to a camp on all four ritual days.

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-m_d.svg)

## Pilgrim Routes {auto-animate="true" .smaller}

These bottlenecks should not be overcrowded at any time during the Hajj.

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
How can we model 

time preferences?
:::

::: footer
:::

## Time Preferences

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-solap-1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Time preference satisfaction

- Assign **one departure time slot** 
- Assigned per ritual day to each pilgrim group
- [Minimize difference between assigned and preferred time]{.highlight}
- Different **penalty functions** are possible

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## Group time preferences
May be computed, i.e., down-sampled given a distribution of pilgrims over time.
:::

## Penalty Functions

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-satisfaction.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Fluctuations

[Question:]{.question} **What could become a problem?**

. . .

- If allowed demand between periods **varies strongly**, accidents are **more likely to happen!**
- We need keep the [changes between periods within bounds]{.highlight}

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Any idea how we can do that later?**

. . .

- Restrict the change of the utilization **between periods**

## Goals Summarized

::: {.incremental}
1. Satisfy **time preferences of the pilgrims** as much as possible under the consideration of **infrastructure bottleneck flow capacities** by assigning "something" to a time slot.
2. For the sake of **simplicity and safety**, pilgrims coming from one camp will always have to be assigned **the same path**.
3. We need to keep track of the **relative utilization** of each resource **to restrict the fluctuations** between periods to ensure a safer event.
:::

# [Model Formulation]{.flow} {.title}

## Sets?

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the sets here?**

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-m_e.svg)

## Sets

- $\mathcal{T}$ - Stoning periods in ascending order, indexed by $t$
- $\mathcal{R}$ - Infrastructure resources, indexed by $r$
- $\mathcal{C}$ - Pilgrim camps, indexed by $c$
- $\mathcal{P}$ - Paths that include the stoning, indexed by $p$
- $\mathcal{S}$ - Scheduling groups, indexed by $s$

. . .

[But we further need subsets!]{.task}

## Subsets

- $\mathcal{S}_c$ - Scheduling groups in camp $c$
- $\mathcal{S}_p$ - Scheduling groups that can use path $p$
- $\mathcal{P}_c$ - Feasible paths for camp $c$
- $\mathcal{P}_s$ - Feasible paths for group $s$
- $\mathcal{P}_r$ - Paths that contain the resource $r$
- $\mathcal{T}_s$ - Available stoning periods for scheduling group $s$

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
That looks 

complicated...
:::

::: footer
:::

## On Subsets

[Question:]{.question} **Why use subsets?**

. . .

- It may seem **like a lot**
- But it also [really helps a lot!]{.highlight}
- We **reduce the problem size**

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
A smaller problem size **reduces the solution space** and **helps the solver** in finding the optimal solution faster!
:::

## Parameters?

[Question:]{.question} **What could be possible parameters?**

. . .

- $n_s$ - Number of pilgrims in scheduling group $s$
- $f_{s,t}$ - Penalty value of assigning period $t$ to group $s$
- $a_{p,r}$ - Offset between stoning and utilization period of $r$ on $p$
- $b_{r,t}$ - Capacity of resource $r$ in period $t$
- $\sigma_r$ - max. relative utilization deviation between $t$ for $r$

## First Decision Variable?

::: {.callout-important}
## Our first goal is to:
Satisfy time preferences of the pilgrims as much as possible under the consideration of infrastructure bottleneck flow capacities by assigning "something" to a time slot.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following sets:

- Scheduling groups, $s \in \mathcal{S}$
- Stoning periods in ascending order, $t \in \mathcal{T}$
- Paths that include the stoning of the devil, $p \in \mathcal{P}$
:::

## First Decision Variable

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our decision variable?**

. . .

- $X_{s,t,p}$ - 1, if scheduling group $s$ is scheduled to perform stoning in period $t$ and to use path $p$, 0 otherwise.

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Do you get the idea here?**

. . .

It's a **binary assignment** of a group to a time slot and a path.

## Second Decision Variable?

::: {.callout-important}
## Our second goal (more a constraint):
For the sake of **simplicity and safety**, pilgrims coming from one camp will always have to be assigned the same path.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following sets:

- Pilgrim camps from which groups can depart, $c \in \mathcal{C}$
- Paths that include the stoning of the devil, $p \in \mathcal{P}$
:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our second variable?**

## Second Decision Variable

- $Y_{c,p}$ - 1, if camp $c$ is assigned to use path $p$, 0 otherwise

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Does anyone remember the third part?**

## Third Decision Variable?

::: {.callout-important}
## Our third goal (again, more a constraint):
We need to keep track of the relative utilization of each resource to restrict the fluctuations between periods to ensure a safer event.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following sets:

- Infrastructure resources, $r \in \mathcal{R}$
- Stoning periods in ascending order, $t \in \mathcal{T}$
:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our third variable?**

## Third Decision Variable

- $U_{r,t}$ - Relative utilization of $r$ in $t$ with $0 \leq U_{rt} \leq 1$

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What does relative utilization mean?**

. . .

- It's a **percentage** of the capacity usage of the resource
- **Normalizes** the capacities between different resources

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
Let's start with our

objective function!
:::

::: footer
:::

## Objective Function?

::: {.callout-important}
## Our main objective is to:

Satisfy time preferences of the pilgrims as much as possible under the consideration of infrastructure bottleneck flow capacities by assigning "something" to a time slot. **Hint:** We thus could aim to minimize the total dissatisfaction with the timetable.
:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **How could we minimize the total dissatisfaction?**

::: {.incremental}
- **Penalize** difference between assigned and preferred time
- Different penalty functions, e.g., linear, quadratic, etc.
:::

## Objective Function

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following parameters and variables:

- $f_{s,t}$ - Penalty value of assigning period $t$ to group $s$
- $X_{s,t,p}$ - 1 if group $s$ is scheduled to perform stoning in $t$ and to use $p$, 0 otherwise

:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our objective function?**

. . .

$$
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}}\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}}\sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}} f_{s,t} \times X_{s,t,p}
$$

## Objective Function Characteristics

[Question:]{.question} **Is our objective function linear?**

. . .

- We can use **non-linear penalty functions**
- But still, it will always be **linear**

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Anybody an idea why?**

. . .

- We can compute the **penalties in advance**
- Do **not** depend on the decision variables

# [Constraints]{.flow} {.title}

## Constraints needed?

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-model_flow.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Key Constraints

[Question:]{.question} **Which constraints do we need?**

::: {.incremental}
1. Each group must have [one path assigned]{.highlight}
2. Each camp must have [one path assigned]{.highlight}
3. Each group must have [one time slot assigned]{.highlight}
4. Each resource must have [a capacity limit]{.highlight}
5. Constraint the [relative utilization between periods]{.highlight}
:::

## Assign Paths to Camps

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of this constraint is to:
Assign **one path to each camp** over the entire time horizon.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following variables:

- $Y_{c,p}$ - 1 if camp $c$ is assigned to use path $p$, 0 otherwise

:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the constraint?**

$$
\sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}_c} Y_{c,p} = 1 \quad \forall c \in \mathcal{C}
$$

## Assign Time Slots to Groups?

::: {.callout-important}    
## The goal of this constraint is to:
Assign **one time slot to each group** over the entire time horizon **using the same path** we have assigned to the camp in the previous constraint.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following variables:

- $X_{s,t,p}$ - 1 if group $s$ is scheduled to perform stoning in $t$ and to use $p$, 0 otherwise
- $Y_{c,p}$ - 1 if camp $c$ is assigned to use path $p$, 0 otherwise

:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the constraint?**

## Assign Time Slots to Groups

$$
\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_s} X_{s,t,p}  = Y_{c,p} \quad  \forall c \in \mathcal{C}, p \in \mathcal{P}_c, s \in \mathcal{S}_c
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We use the following sets:

- $\mathcal{C}$ - Pilgrim camps
- $\mathcal{S}_c$ - Scheduling groups in camp $c$
- $\mathcal{T}_s$ - Available stoning periods for scheduling group $s$
- $\mathcal{P}_c$ - Feasible paths for camp $c$

:::

## Relative Utilization and Capacities

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of this constraint is to:
Compute the relative utilization of each resource while also ensuring that the utilization does not exceed the capacity limit. [This one is very tricky!]{.highlight}
:::

. . .

[Difficulties:]{.highlight}

- Includes the time-shift between stoning and utilization
- Used as parameter to shift periods in variable $X_{s,t,p}$

## Compute Relative Utilization?

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following:

- $n_s$ - Number of pilgrims in scheduling group $s$
- $a_{p,r}$ - Period offset between stoning period and utilization period of $r$ on $p$
- $b_{r,t}$ - Capacity of resource $r$ in period $t$ in number of pilgrims
- $X_{s,t,p}$ - 1, if $s$ is scheduled to perform stoning in $t$ and to use $p$, 0 else 
- $U_{r,t}$ - Relative utilization of resource $r$ in period $t$ with $0 \leq U_{r,t} \leq 1$

:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the constraint?**

## Compute Relative Utilization

$$
\sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}_r}\sum_{s \in S_p} n_s \times X_{s,t-a_{p,r},p}  = b_{r,t}\times U_{r,t} \quad \forall r \in \mathcal{R}, t \in \mathcal{T}
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We use the following:

- $n_s$ - Number of pilgrims in scheduling group $s$
- $a_{p,r}$ - Period offset between stoning period and utilization period of $r$ on $p$
- $b_{r,t}$ - Capacity of resource $r$ in period $t$ in number of pilgrims
- $X_{s,t,p}$ - 1, if $s$ is scheduled to perform stoning in $t$ and to use $p$, 0 else 
- $U_{r,t}$ - Relative utilization of resource $r$ in period $t$ with $0 \leq U_{r,t} \leq 1$

## How does the shift work?

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_pilgrim-model_flow.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Keep Fluctuations within Bounds?

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of this constraint is to:
Keep the relative utilization of each resource within bounds to ensure a safer event.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following:

- $\sigma_r$ - max. relative utilization deviation between $t$ for $r$
- $U_{r,t}$ - Relative utilization of resource $r$ in period $t$ with $0 \leq U_{rt} \leq 1$

:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the constraint?**

## Keep Fluctuations within Bounds

$$
U_{r,t} - U_{r,t-1} \leq \sigma_r \quad \forall (r,t) \in \left| \mathcal{R}\times \mathcal{T}\right|
$$

$$
U_{r,t-1} - U_{r,t} \leq \sigma_r \quad \forall (r,t) \in \left| \mathcal{R}\times \mathcal{T}\right|
$$

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Can somebody explain why this works?**

- Each constraint limits the **change**
- The first one limits the **increase**
- The second one limits the **decrease**
