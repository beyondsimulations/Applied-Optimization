## Challenges for Live Events

- Overall number of participants at events **was restricted**
- Certain **spacing between participants** had to be ensured  
- Larger events required **vaccination certificates** for all

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What are the main issues for the organizers?**

## Main Difficulties

- Organization of larger events **is costly**
- Even without a pandemic a **financial risk**
- **Administrative Burden** for vaccination certificates
- Reduced capacity is a **loss of revenue**
- Implementing and enforcing **distancing rules**
- Managing **different priorities** of groups

## [Idea: Optimizing Seating Plans]{.invert-font} {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1602453870769-970391ee6fc1?q=80&w=3925&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" background-size="cover" background-position="center"}

## Background

- **Applications:** sport arenas, concert halls, movie theaters, lecture halls, etc.
- People from the same group are **seated together**
- Venues have **specific seating**, season tickets, VIPs, etc.

. . .

:::{.callout-important}
Optimizing seating plans can help to **maximize revenue** while ensuring distancing rules and other constraints are met.

## Different Approaches Possible

1. Operational
2. Tactical
3. Strategic

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What are these approaches in general and how do they relate to arena seating?**

## Operational

  - **Short-term**, day-to-day decisions
  - Focused on [immediate execution]{.highlight}

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What is an example for this approach?**

. . .

- Given **tomorrow's demand** of differently sized groups
- Score groups (importance, sponsors, VIP, season ticket,...)
- Assigning specific seats for **tomorrow's event**

## Tactical
  
- **Medium-term** planning (weeks to months)
- Bridges operational and strategic levels

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What is an example for this approach?**

. . .

- Given distribution of **expected demand** for groups
- Score groups (importance, sponsors, VIP, season ticket,...)
- Plan seating arrangements for an **upcoming season**
  
## Strategic

- Long-term planning (months to years)
- Focus on overall goals and policies

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What is an example for this approach?**

. . .

- Designing flexible seating layouts that work for scenarios
- Maximize the overall **space utilization**
- Sell the resulting maximized seating pattern on **market**

## [Main Question]{.invert-font} {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1604975701397-6365ccbd028a?q=80&w=2670&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" background-size="cover" background-position="center"}

# [Knapsack]{.flow} {.title}

## Knapsack Problem

![](https://images.byndsim.com/ao/ao_arena-knapsack.svg)

-  [Standard model in Operations Research]{.highlight}
-  **Select items** from a pool under **capacity constraints**

## Knapsack Problem in 2D

![](https://images.byndsim.com/ao/ao_arena-knapsack_2d.svg)

- Now, Items block space in 2D, as illustrated here

## Adaption to Seating

- Horizontal dimension to place groups of participants
- Vertical dimension to ensure enough spacing between rows
- Maximize the "value" of the allocated groups
- Value can be the number of seats or a score

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
Idea behind the model was developed by [Dr. Matthes Koch](https://www.desior.net/).
:::

## Hands-on Exercise

[Task:]{.task} **Allocate as many high-value groups as possible.**

![](https://images.byndsim.com/ao/ao_arena-empty_exercise.svg)

## Available Groups {.smaller}

| Grouptype | Req. Seats | Score | Available | Allocated | Value |
|-----------|------------|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| a         | 1          | 1     | 3         |           |        |
| b         | 2          | 2     | 2         |           |        |
| c         | 2          | 4     | 3         |           |        |
| d         | 4          | 4     | 5         |           |        |
| e         | 4          | 5     | 2         |           |        |
| f         | 6          | 6     | 1         |           |        |
| g         | 6          | 12    | 1         |           |        |
| **Total** |            |       |           |           |        |

## Seating Constraints

- 1 empty seat **between** groups
- 1 empty seat **front-to-back**
- 1 empty seat **diagonally**
- Only **2 groups per row** are allowed
- Grey seats represent **obstacles**

. . .

You have 5 minutes to find a solution.

[Question:]{.question} **What is your total score?**

# [Model Formulation]{.flow} {.title}

## Sets?

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the sets?**

. . .

- $\mathcal{G}$ - Set of groups, indexed by $g$
- $\mathcal{R}$ - Set of rows, indexed by $r$
- $\mathcal{C}$ - Set of columns, indexed by $c$
- $\mathcal{C}_r$ - Available seats of row $r$, indexed by $c$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
$\mathcal{C}_r$ ensures that we only consider unblocked seats in each row.
:::

## Parameters?

[Question:]{.question} **What could be possible parameters?**

. . .

- $p_r$ - Maximal number of groups allowed in one row $r$
- $d_g$ - Required seats of a group $g$ in a row
- $h$ - Safety distance between groups sitting next to each other
- $b$ - Vertical safety distance between groups
- $v_g$ - Value of an allocation of the group $g$

# [Variables and Objective]{.flow} {.title}

## Decision Variable?

::: {.callout-important}
## Our goal is to:
Maximize the group values by filling the seating area given distancing regulations between groups and venue-specific constraints.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Each group is represented by **one binary variable**. We don't need to block each seat explicitly with a binary variable!
:::


## Decision Variable

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following sets:

- All the groups, $g \in \mathcal{G}$
- All the rows, $r \in \mathcal{R}$
- All the columns, $c \in \mathcal{C}$
:::

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our decision variable?**

. . .

- $X_{g,r,c}$ - 1, if **first left seat** of $g$ is assigned to $r$ in $c$, else 0

## Objective Function?

::: {.callout-important}
## Our main objective is to:

Maximize the group values by filling the seating area given distancing regulations between groups and venue-specific constraints.
:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **How again are groups allocated?**

. . .

- By the allocation of the **first left seat** of a group to a row and column in the seating area

## Objective Function

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following parameters and variables:

- $v_g$ - Value of an allocation of the group $g$
- $X_{g,r,c}$ - 1, if **first left seat** of $g$ is assigned to $r$ in $c$, else 0

:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our objective function?**

. . .

$$
\text{maximize} \quad \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} \sum_{c\in \mathcal{C}_r} v_g \times X_{grc}
$$

# [Constraints]{.flow} {.title}

## Necessary Constraints

[Question:]{.question} **What constraints do we need?**

. . .

- Assign **each group only once**
- Restrict the **number of groups in each row**
- Ensure the **horizontal social distance**
- Keep the **vertical social distance**

## Assign Each Group Only Once?

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of this constraint is to:
Ensure that each group is allocated only once in the entire seating area.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following:

- $X_{g,r,c}$ - 1, if first left seat of $g$ is assigned to $r$ in $c$, else 0
- $\mathcal{G}$ - Set of groups, indexed by $g$
- $\mathcal{R}$ - Set of rows, indexed by $r$
- $\mathcal{C}_r$ - Set of columns of row $r$, indexed by $c$
:::

## Assign Each Group Only Once

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the constraint?**

. . .

$$
\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}_r} X_{g,r,c} \leq 1 \quad \forall g \in \mathcal{G}
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
This "set packing" constraint ensures that a group is only **assigned once**.
:::

## Restrict Groups Per Row?

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of this constraint is to:
Ensure that the number of groups in each row does not exceed the maximum allowed number of groups.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following:

- $p_r$ - Maximal number of groups allowed in one row $r$
- $X_{g,r,c}$ - 1, if first left seat of $g$ is assigned to $r$ in $c$, else 0

:::

## Assign Each Group Only Once

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the constraint?**

. . .

$$
\sum_{g\in \mathcal{G}}\sum_{c\in \mathcal{C}} X_{g,r,c} \leq p_{r} \quad r \in \mathcal{R}
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
We want to place as **many highly scoring groups as possible**, but people need to move to buy drinks or use restroom. Depending on the venue, they should **not cross other groups** in the **same row**.
:::

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
The last two

constraints are

somewhat tricky!

# [Social Distance Implementation]{.flow} {.title}


## Central Idea

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_arena-two_groups.png)

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}

Assume **one seat between groups must be kept empty**. If one group takes seat 8, it uses seats 8 and 9. We thus **cannot allocate** another group of size 2 to seats 6, 7 or 8. 

:::

## Horizontal Social Distance?

[Question:]{.question} **Any ideas how to implement this?**

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of this constraint is to:
Ensure that the horizontal social distance is maintained between groups.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following:

- $X_{g,r,c}$ - 1, if first left seat of $g$ is assigned to $r$ in $c$, else 0
- $d_g$ - Required seats of group $g$ in a row
- $h$ - Safety distance between groups sitting next to each other

:::

## Horizontal Social Distance

As the constraint is based on a rather complex set, you don't have to find it by yourself.

. . .

$$\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{\tilde{c} \in \mathcal{C}_{c,g}} X_{g,r,\tilde{c}} \leq 1 \quad \forall r\in \mathcal{R}, c\in \mathcal{C}$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
At first glance, this constraint [looks rather easy]{.highlight}, but it is not -  it is based on the set $\mathcal{C}_{c,g}$ not defined yet in the lecture.
:::

## The Social Distancing Set

$$\mathcal{C}_{c,g} = \{\tilde{c}\in \mathcal{C}| c - d_g + 1 - h \leq \tilde{c} \leq c \}$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## Remember:

- $d_g$ - Required seats of group $g$ in a row
- $h$ - Safety distance between groups sitting next to each other

:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Can anybody explain the set?**

## Example: Two Groups {.smaller}

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_arena-two_groups.png)

$$\underbrace{X_{1,2,\textbf{6}}+X_{1,2,\textbf{7}}+X_{1,2,\textbf{8}}}_{g=1} + \underbrace{X_{2,2,\textbf{6}}+X_{2,2,\textbf{7}}+X_{2,2,\textbf{8}}}_{g=2} \leq 1 \quad (r=2,c=8)$$

## Example: Different Group Sizes {.smaller}

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_arena-two_groups_b.png)

$$\underbrace{X_{1,2,\textbf{6}}+X_{1,2,\textbf{7}}+X_{1,2,\textbf{8}}}_{g=1} + \underbrace{X_{2,2,\textbf{5}}+X_{2,2,\textbf{6}}+X_{2,2,\textbf{7}}+X_{2,2,\textbf{8}}}_{g=2} \leq 1 \quad (r=2,c=8)$$

## Example: Three Groups {.smaller}

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_arena-three_groups.png)

::: {.temp-math-size}

```{=html}
<style>
.temp-math-size .math.display .MathJax  {
  font-size: 85% !important;
}
</style>
```
$$
\underbrace{X_{1,2,\textbf{6}}+X_{1,2,\textbf{7}}+X_{1,2,\textbf{8}}}_{g=1} + \underbrace{X_{2,2,\textbf{6}}+X_{2,2,\textbf{7}}+X_{2,2,\textbf{8}}}_{g=2} + \underbrace{X_{3,2,\textbf{5}}+X_{3,2,\textbf{6}}+X_{3,2,\textbf{7}}+X_{3,2,\textbf{8}}}_{g=3} \leq 1 \quad (r=2,c=8)
$$

:::

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
Do you see

the pattern?
:::

::: footer
:::

## Vertical Social Distance?

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of this constraint is to:
Ensure that the vertical social distance is maintained between groups.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following:

- $b$ - Vertical safety distance between groups
- $X_{g,r,c}$ - 1, if first left seat of $g$ is assigned to $r$ in $c$, else 0

:::


## Vertical Social Distance

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the constraint?**

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
It is an extension of the horizontal social distance constraint we used before, but now we **block a rectangular area** instead of a single row.
:::

. . .

$$
\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{\tilde{r} \in \mathcal{R}_r} \sum_{\tilde{c} \in \tilde{\mathcal{C}}_{cg}} X_{g\tilde{r}\tilde{c}} \leq 1 \quad \forall r\in \mathcal{R}, c\in \mathcal{C}
$$

## Vertical Distance Set

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the set?**

. . .

$$
\mathcal{R}_{r} = \{\tilde{r}\in \mathcal{R}| r-b \leq \tilde{r} \leq r \}
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
Remember:

- $b$ - Vertical safety distance between groups
- $X_{g,r,c}$ - 1, if first left seat of $g$ is assigned to $r$ in $c$, else 0

:::

. . .

Let's look at an [example]{.highlight}.

## Example: Two Groups

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_arena-two_groups_vertical_b.png)

- Yellow seats are **blocked by the group** in row 3 and column 8
- Blue allocations are possible (if second group has **size 2**)

## Arena Seating Problem

::: {.temp-math-size}

```{=html}

```

$$
\text{maximize} \quad \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} \sum_{c\in \mathcal{C}_r} v_g \times X_{g,r,c}
$$
subject to:
$$
\begin{align*}
& \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}}\sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}_r} X_{g,r,c} \leq 1 && \forall g \in \mathcal{G} \\
& \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}}\sum_{c\in \mathcal{C}_r} X_{g,r,c} \leq p_r && \forall r \in \mathcal{R} \\
& \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{\tilde{r} \in \mathcal{R}_r} \sum_{\tilde{c} \in \tilde{\mathcal{C}}_{c,g}} X_{g,\tilde{r},\tilde{c}} \leq 1 && \forall r\in \mathcal{R}, c\in \mathcal{C} \\
& X_{g,r,c} \in \{0,1\} && \forall g \in \mathcal{G}, \forall r\in \mathcal{R}, c\in \mathcal{C}_r
\end{align*}
