        "\n",
        "2.  The second way is by using IJulia. Start Julia, and type\n",
        "    `using IJulia; notebook()` in the Julia prompt. This will open a new\n",
        "    browser window where you can run the code. If you have not installed\n",
        "    IJulia yet, you can do so by typing `]` in the Julia prompt to open\n",
