    "section": "",
    "text": "Course Description\nIn this module we will focus on solving practical problems with the help of optimization. To this end, over the course of the semester you will become familiar with a number of optimization problems that have been worked on in the past at the Institute of Logistics, Transportation and Production in cooperation with practice partners. Problems include improving the sustainability of parcel delivery companies, Corona-compliant seat allocations of stadiums and theaters, optimizing districts and locations for police departments, and many more. The module consists of the following two parts: Lectures (2 SWS) and Exercises (1 SWS).\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\nYou can find our specific outcomes in the module handbook. Our broader goal is to introduce you to how diversified the solution of practical problems can be. We want to enable you to independently apply methods and concepts from optimization, and to get a feeling for abstracting and modeling problems. Is our module hard? That’s a subjective question. We would say it is exciting and doable. If you have a basic interest in logical relationships and mathematics, you are in the right place. If you also have basic knowledge of programming or want to get into the subject with help, our module is perfect for you.\nUpon completion of the course, you …\n\ncan implement solutions to complex optimization problems in Julia\nknow advanced concepts of optimization such as linear and nonlinear optimization\nknow basic concepts of programming and algorithms such as loops, functions\nwill be able to read and write code in Julia\nwill have experience working with Julia libraries such as JuMP and HiGHS\nwill know how to collaborate in a small team to find solutions for problems at hand\n\nPlease note that this course is specifically designed for business students. That is, it is not required to have any advanced knowledge or experience in programming to attend this course. The teaching format will make it possible to account for different levels of programming skills such that every student can take the most out of the course.\n\n\nCourse Blocks\nThe core content of the course is organized in three blocks:\n\nPart I: Introduction to Julia and Modelling\nPart II: Applied Optimization with Basic Models\nPart III: Applied Optimization with Advanced Models\n\nYou can find more information on the course blocks and the corresponding lectures in the syllabus.\n\n\nTutorials\nThe tutorials accompany the lectures. In the tutorials, you will apply the concepts from the lectures to realistic data sets. You will work in small groups of 3 participants, in which you can work out solutions together. We will help you during the weekly practice sessions by answering your questions or briefly explaining individual issues in case of difficulties. Afterwards, you have the opportunity to submit your jointly developed solution until the next exercise date in order to earn bonus points for the exam. You can earn up to half a bonus point per exercise, up to 6.5 bonus points in total. Important: the bonus points will only be credited to you if you pass the exam with at least a 4.0. Furthermore, we will not award bonus points for exercises in which you have simply copied the results of another group.\n\n\nHow to see the slides\n\nThis course is based on Quarto\nIt uses revealjs to render the slides\nYou find the slides for each lecture in the corresponding lecture\nTo see the slides, click on RevealJS in the top right corner\n\n\n\nQuestions\nIf you have any questions regarding the course, please contact me under tobias.vlcek@uni-hamburg.de.\n\n\nContributors\nThanks to Matthes Koch and Justus Bonz, who helped to prepare the lecture materials.",
